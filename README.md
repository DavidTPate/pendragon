# Traits
Every story of King Arthur and his knights, whether taken from the romances, legends, or Hollywood movies, is full of
characters with remarkable personality and passion. This game emphasizes those points.

Traits and passions are game mechanics for quantifying your character’s inner self, recording both repute and propensity.
They help you run your character in a consistent manner and according to his actual play activity.

A value of 16 or more in a particular trait or passion indicates tremendous interest and activity in that quality,
perhaps bordering on the fanatical. The behavior is very obvious to everyone, and is thus significant in roleplaying
terms as well as in game terms. New characters start play with only one value of 16, in one trait of your choice.

## Traits by Religion
The personality traits used in Pendragon consist of thirteen opposed pairs of virtues and vices. Note, though, that
what is a virtue in one culture is sometimes a vice in another. Thus, Christian and pagan cultures, for instance,
view the contrast between Modesty and Pride in a very different light.

All initial characters begin with a moral base derived from either British or Roman Christianity or from Paganism.

To determine your character’s starting traits, follow these three steps:

### Step 1: Religious Background
Initial traits are modified by the religious background. On your character sheet, underline those traits which your
character’s religion deems the most important, as follows:

#### Roman Christian Virtues
* Chaste
* Forgiving
* Merciful
* Modest
* Temperate

#### British Christian Values
* Chaste
* Energetic
* Generous
* Modest
* Temperate

#### Pagan Virtues
* Generous
* Energetic
* Honest
* Lustful
* Proud

### Step 2: Assign Values to the Traits
The Valorous trait always begins at a value of 15, reflecting your character’s martial training. The Religious traits
listed above begin at a value of 13. All of the remaining traits begin at 10.

Next, note that every "virtue" has its opposing "vice," located on the opposite side of the slash. For example,
Forgiving is balanced by Vengeful, and Prudent by Reckless. The total on the two sides of the slash must equal 20.
Complete your trait statistics by subtracting the values you have already assigned from 20, and filling in the resulting
number opposite the chosen trait. Thus, if your character has a score of 13 in Forgiving, he also has a 7 in Vengeful;
if he has a 10 in Prudent, he also has a 10 in Reckless.

As your character develops, these initial values will change, and various rewards may become available. For more
information, see ["Traits" in Chapter 4](#LINK-ME).

### Step 3: Assign Your "Famous Trait"
You may assign a value of 16 to any one trait, including those on the right side of each binary, such as Worldly or
Reckless, if you desire. Assigning this value of 16 is optional. If you do assign a 16, put it in a trait that denotes
the behavior for which you wish your character to be renowned. Be sure to adjust the corresponding trait
(the opposite side of the binary pair) to a value of 4.

**Important**: For your first character, be sure to choose a "famous trait" you can live with. Since this value shows
how your character has acted in his youth, be sure the trait is in line with your intended actions and attitudes for the
character.

Further, note that having a trait over 15 decidedly affects the player’s actual control over a character! Your
character’s actions may be determined by the trait and contrary to your wishes as a player. For example, a character
with an Honest trait of 16 tells the truth in almost all situations, even those where deception might be advisable!
The game system assures this.

See [Chapter 4 for more information on traits](#LINK-ME).

## Directed Traits
Leave these blank for now. They are discovered during game play.

# Passions
Passions are strong emotional and psychological propensities within any individual. These include Love, Hate, Loyalty,
Envy, and Honor, among others. Beginning characters all begin with ﬁve passions: Loyalty (to their lord), Love
(of family), Hospitality, Honor, and Hate (of Saxons).

## Starting Passions
Passion | Starting Value
------- | --------------
Loyalty (lord) | 15
Love (family) | 15
Hospitality | 15
Honor | 15
Hate (Saxons) | Roll 3d6

Once these values are assigned, a player may (but need not) raise one or more of her character’s passions by
distributing up to 3 points among them. See [Chapter 4 for more information on passions](#LINK-ME).

## Types of Passions
The Gamemaster might allow other passions for a character by at the start, and characters acquire passions as the result
of game play. The core passions are listed below:

### Loyalty
Loyalty is the prime virtue and passion of the medieval world — without it the feudal system could not exist. Most
knights believe in the axiom “King before God.” Showing obedience to one’s immediate overlord is always correct
behavior, and disobedience to a lord is shocking to all true knights.

### Love (of family)
Love of family is a natural emotion common to humankind in any age or culture. To most people, family equates to society
in microcosm, which in turn represents their world. Further, the travel restrictions of the Arthurian era emphasize
family closeness.

### Hospitality
Everyone learns Hospitality at his or her mother’s knee, and it is so ingrained that it is almost subconscious.

### Honor
* Honor is the knight’s special passion. All knights must retain a value of 4 or higher in Honor, or they risk losing
their knighthood. (See [Honor in Chapter 4 for more information.](#LINK-ME))

### Hatred (of Saxons)
Hatred of the Saxons is an inherited passion of all Salisbury residents.
