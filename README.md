# Traits
Traits and passions allow us to quantify character behavior. Thus, they make the player's roleplaying task easier by
providing guidelines for how the character has acted in the past, and thus how he is likely to continue to act.
Numerical values are assigned to each trait and each passion, and rolls are made using these values to determine
behavior. Of the two measures of character behavior, personality traits are more often used than passions.

Keeping track of character reputation is important. Characters with similar Glory totals may have very different
reputations, some good, some bad, some simply colorful.

Traits and passions are game mechanics for quantifying your character's inner self, recording both repute and propensity.
They help you run your character in a consistent manner and according to his actual play activity.

## Ordinary Traits and Passions
Traits and passions between 5 and 15 do not have to be rolled against if the player wishes to use his free will to
determine an action, although rolling is obviously the most impartial way to determine actions.

Characters who consistently act a certain way will eventually have the appropriate traits or passions valued at 16 or
higher, due to the rules below, at which time they will either have to make the required rolls or retire the character.

> **Modifiers**: Trait or passion values may be modified based on the situation, in order to keep the game realistic.
Players are responsible for reminding the Gamemaster when a situation might call for a trait or passion modifier. The
Gamemaster determines whether such modifiers are valid, and how much of a modifier should be applied.

## Famous Traits and Passions
A value of 16 or more in a particular trait or passion indicates tremendous interest and activity in that quality,
perhaps bordering on the fanatical. The behavior is very obvious to everyone, and is thus significant in roleplaying
terms as well as in game terms. New characters start play with only one value of 16, in one trait of your choice.

The threshold value for gaining Glory from a trait or passion is 16. if your knight has a Valorous trait of 15, he is
brave, but not particularly noteworthy for courage. Nor is a priest with a Piety of 6 particularly impious, nor is a
Love passion of 11 at all worthy of notice. But a knight whose Valorous statistic reaches 16 is considered heroic
beyond many other men and one with a Piety of 18 is nearly a saint, while a Love passion of 20 denotes one as being
famous throughout the realm for his passion.

This does not mean that trait rolls must be used whenever the character makes any decision in the game. And even
characters with famous characteristics are allowed free choice of behavior except when the plot demands otherwise. The
Gamemaster should request trait rolls only when a trait is tested in an important situation. in general, trait rolls
simulate situations in which a crisis forces the character to act unconsciously.

## Traits Over 19
Some extraordinary characters may have a trait valued of 20, 25, or perhaps even more! Scores above 19 are always the
result of increases made during the Winter Phase (or perhaps by Gamemaster fiat). Such characters always have a value of
0 for the opposite trait, and are known through all the land for their unrelenting, utterly fanatical behavior.

Unopposed rolls against these traits are handled as with any other unopposed roll having a value of 20 or higher — the
score is treated as 20, and any amount in excess of 20 is treated as a modifier to the roll itself.

As usual, trait values should be listed in pencil on the character sheet as whole numbers, each to one side of the
slash (/) mark.

## Penalizing and Reducing Traits and Passions
Values for traits and passions generally rise and fall repeatedly during the game. Experience checks for traits and
passions are assigned by the Gamemaster in a slightly different fashion from checks for skills
(see [Obtaining Experience](#obtaining-experience)). Players who are reluctant to roll should not be forced to;
however, if they consistently have their characters act against their established personalities, the Gamemaster must
have them check the trait or passion they actually exhibited, in order to simulate the possibility of a change in the
character's psychology and reputation.

For example, the player of a knight with a Generous value of 13 wants to loot and pillage his foes at every turn and
constantly talks about the amount of money (or lack thereof) his character has. This attitude and behavior is not in
keeping with the Generous trait, so the Gamemaster is perfectly within his rights to tell the character to check his
Selfish trait the next time he expresses the desire to loot an enemy.

Passions are particularly vulnerable to reduction. When a character acts against a passion, no check is assigned -
instead, the Gamemaster simply instructs the player to reduce the value of the passion by 1 point immediately.

> **Note**: Any failed passion roll causes the character to lose 1 point.

Acting consistently according to character will prevent compulsory checks and reductions from being imposed.

The traits and passions system is not to be used to turn the player knights into puppets. Most of the time characters
just do whatever the player wishes them to do, collecting checks along the way. However, if your character has a
reputation, it's only fair that he maintains it or loses it.

## Evil or Undesirable Behavior
it is not at all in the spirit of the game for player characters to become evil knights. However, players are
encouraged to take minor character flaws such as cruelty or laziness for their characters; such traits can be very
amusing in moderation, and also provide the Gamemaster with more opportunities to create interesting situations.

With one or two undesirable traits or inferior passion values, characters can have weaknesses other than those revealed
only in mortal combat, giving the Gamemaster the possibility of creating non-lethal challenges for characters. Given
the dangers involved in combat, this is a useful opportunity.

## Using Traits
When the opportunity arises to have your character behave one way or another, traits can be used as casual guidelines,
or rolls against the appropriate trait may be imposed by the Gamemaster.

Since traits and passions define character personality, they must be consulted whenever the Gamemaster feels them
necessary. in crises, it is assumed, individuals act according to their character, not spontaneous and ambiguous
choices. Custom and training triumph over instinct. Players may not want their characters to do something dictated by a
die roll, but free choice is not always possible.

Most of the time, you simply state what you want your character to do and he does it, possibly receiving an experience
check in the process (see [Obtaining Experience](#obtaining-experience)). Sometimes, though, behavior takes precedent
over conscious intent. Most of us have experienced doing something without thinking, and a trait roll duplicates that
kind of situation.

Modifiers may be used to underscore the demands and pressures of a situation.

### Standard Trait Roll Results

Roll Result | Effect
----------- | ------
Critical Success | An experience check is normally gained, and the character acts strongly in accordance with the trait.
Success | The character acts in accordance with the trait. The player may decide precisely what action ensues within that limitation. An experience check should be gained only if the action is somehow significant to the story or the character
Failure | Roll again, this time against the opposed trait. Success on this second roll means the character acts in accordance with that second trait. Failure indicates the player may choose freely how the character will act. No checks are given.
Fumble | The opposite trait is checked, and the character immediately acts in accordance with the checked trait.

### interpreting Trait Rolls
Each result of a trait roll has special implications, and high or low trait values may influence interpretation. Use of
traits is not the same as striking with a weapon or using a skill. The traits quantify a character's likelihood to act
in one of two generally opposed ways. Therefore it is not enough to know merely that a character does not feel
particularly merciful — the player must know whether the character actually acts cruelly. The binary traits of
Pendragon define the chances of either.

#### Critical Success
A critical success in a trait roll indicates that the character must act in the manner described by the trait. The
action need not be outrageous or extreme, but ought to be apparent enough to be noticed enough by others, and to make
the character feel that he has revealed strong emotions or perhaps even compromised his beliefs or his integrity in
some way.

At the Gamemaster's option, minor inspiration may be gained from a critical success with a trait, gaining the character
a +5 modifier to one skill selected by the player, lasting for the duration of the situation that provoked the roll.
Such inspiration should be gained only in rare instances, for it is usually the domain of passions, not traits. Still,
when a truly dramatic trait roll occurs, inspiration can make the process far more exciting. The possibility of
inspiration also makes trait rolls more entertaining in general.

#### Success
Success in a trait roll indicates that the knight felt, and was moved by, the feelings expressed by that trait. Thus,
if he made a Merciful roll, he feels that he should grant mercy in this instance. However, the player may choose to
have the character act in the opposite manner: The penalty for disobeying the roll result is a check in the opposite
trait.

#### Failure
Failure at a single die roll is not enough to force a character to act entirely opposite to his usual patterns of
behavior; the player must also roll against the opposite trait to see if chance and statistics force his character to
break pattern. Thus, only a successful roll within the range of a trait forces the player's hand.

### Conflicting Traits
in some cases, a character may be torn between two warring traits (that is, not an opposed trait pair like
Pious/Worldly, but entirely different virtues, such as Pious and Trusting).

By making an opposed roll between two unrelated traits, you may play your character's emotions off against each other,
emulating the deep introspection of someone tortured by internal doubts. You or your Gamemaster may also set opposed
tests of conflicting emotions, requiring you to make several separate unopposed trait rolls, with varying results
depending on which of them was successful and which failed.

Whichever traits are successful (if unopposed) or win (if opposed) receive experience checks if approved by the Gamemaster.

### Trait Disputes
Personality disputes between individuals, particularly between player knights and non-player characters, may be
determined by opposed resolution rolls of traits. The challenger matches his personality against his rival's.

Because personality traits have opposites, results are more complex when someone fails during opposed trait resolution
than is the case with other opposed skill rolls. Whenever a character receives a failed trait roll during a personality
dispute, his player must then attempt to roll the opposite trait. if that roll succeeds, then the character acts
accordingly, even though this means that behavior is not as intended.

The challenged party in a trait dispute has free reign to do as he pleases when he fails both trait rolls, having
managed to control their inclinations.

## Assigning Traits
The personality traits used in Pendragon consist of thirteen opposed pairs of virtues and vices. Note, though, that
what is a virtue in one culture is sometimes a vice in another. Thus, Christian and pagan cultures, for instance,
view the contrast between Modesty and Pride in a very different light.

All initial characters begin with a moral base derived from either British or Roman Christianity or from Paganism.

To determine your character's starting traits, follow these three steps:

### Step 1: Religious Background
initial traits are modified by the religious background. On your character sheet, mark those traits which your
character's religion deems the most important, as follows:

Religion          | Chaste | Energetic | Forgiving | Generous | Honest | Lustful | Merciful | Modest | Proud | Temperate
----------------- | ------ | --------- | --------- | -------- | ------ | ------- | -------- | ------ | ----- | ---------
Roman Christian   | :x:    |           | :x:       |          |        |         | :x:      | :x:    |       | :x:
British Christian | :x:    | :x:       |           | :x:      |        |         |          | :x:    |       | :x:
Pagan             |        | :x:       |           | :x:      | :x:    | :x:     |          |        | :x:   |

### Step 2: Assign Values to the Traits
The Valorous trait always begins at a value of 15, reflecting your character's martial training. The Religious traits
listed above begin at a value of 13. All of the remaining traits begin at 10.

Next, note that every "virtue" has its opposing "vice," located on the opposite side of the slash. For example,
Forgiving is balanced by Vengeful, and Prudent by Reckless. The total on the two sides of the slash must equal 20.
Complete your trait statistics by subtracting the values you have already assigned from 20, and filling in the resulting
number opposite the chosen trait. Thus, if your character has a score of 13 in Forgiving, he also has a 7 in Vengeful;
if he has a 10 in Prudent, he also has a 10 in Reckless.

As your character develops, these initial values will change, and various rewards may become available.

### Step 3: Assign Your "Famous Trait"
You may assign a value of 16 to any one trait, including those on the right side of each binary, such as Worldly or
Reckless, if you desire. Assigning this value of 16 is optional. if you do assign a 16, put it in a trait that denotes
the behavior for which you wish your character to be renowned. Be sure to adjust the corresponding trait
(the opposite side of the binary pair) to a value of 4.

> **important**: For your first character, be sure to choose a "famous trait" you can live with. Since this value shows
how your character has acted in his youth, be sure the trait is in line with your intended actions and attitudes for the
character.

Further, note that having a trait over 15 decidedly affects the player's actual control over a character! Your
character's actions may be determined by the trait and contrary to your wishes as a player. For example, a character
with an Honest trait of 16 tells the truth in almost all situations, even those where deception might be advisable!
The game system assures this.

## Directed Traits
Leave these blank for now. They are discovered during game play.A character may have strong feelings about someone or
something in particular that modify one or more of their traits. in game, these tendencies are referred to as directed
traits. Directed traits thus represent strong feelings or beliefs, but not strong enough to drive your character mad,
as a passion might (see [Passions])#passions)).

in situations where the directed trait might reasonably alter your character's actions or perceptions, he applies
its numeric value as a modifier on appropriate trait rolls. Some directed traits that might come up in play are as follows:

* Weakness for blondes (adds to Lustful rolls where blondes are involved)
* Mistrust Sir So-and-so (adds to Suspicious rolls where Sir So-and-so is involved)
* Mistrust London residents (adds to Suspicious rolls where London residents are involved)
* Forgiving of crying women (adds to Forgiving rolls where crying women are involved)
* Unjust towards Malahauts (adds to Arbitrary rolls where Malahauts are involved)
* Loves mead (adds to indulgent rolls where mead is involved)
* Fears boars (adds to Cowardly rolls where boars are involved)

## Trait Descriptions

### Chaste/Lustful
To be chaste is to be monogamous, or otherwise faithful to one's sexual mores. it does not always require virginity,
so a man being faithful to his wife is exhibiting the Chaste trait. A chaste person is modest and decorous in terms of
sexual or flirtatious behavior. (Note that a relatively chaste character can still make Flirting checks, but probably
does so in a rather demure or "innocent" manner.) A fanatically or famously chaste person is celibate and most likely
virginal.

Lustful describes sexual desire, and also implies sexual activity, often without personal commitment between the
persons involved. The pagan virtue of Lustful recognizes the value of this sensual art to appreciate the immanence of
the Goddess. Excessive promiscuity may be called lechery, wantonness, or bawdiness.

> **Famous Characters**: Sir Bors de Ganis is respected for his chastity.

### Energetic/Lazy
A vigorous person is Energetic. This trait includes the natural inclination to get up early, work hard, and apply
oneself fully to the tasks at hand. Energetic persons might be called vigorous, robust, or industrious.

Laziness includes all slothful activity, such as loafing and general sedentary behavior. At the furthest end of the
spectrum lies complete indolence.

> **Famous Characters**: Sir Lamorak de Gales is often admired for his energetic nature.

### Forgiving/Vengeful
To be forgiving means is to be willing to take insult without injury. A forgiving character is unlikely to seek revenge
for injuries intended or done to him. Extremely forgiving people are called "meek" (in the Biblical sense).

Vengeful indicates a character's propensity to seek revenge — perhaps only in petty ways, but possibly sweeping and
grandiose — for wrongs done or imagined. This trait also includes spitefulness.

> **Famous Characters**: Sir Gawaine is often noted for his vengeful streak.

### Generous/Selfish
Generous determines the impulse, learning, or desire to share with others. it includes the largesse of the Saxon and 
Cymric chieftains, and also the famed Christian virtue of Charity. Extremely generous persons are called unselfish, 
magnanimous, and big-hearted.

Selfish is the desire to possess, keep, and further accumulate things for oneself. Greed is usually a component of 
selfishness. This possessiveness usually regards material property and wealth, with the character being known as a 
miser or hoarder, but it might apply to Glory, so that the character always wishes to keep the most glorious tasks and 
duties for himself. Very selfish persons are labeled both stingy and self-serving.

> _Note: in some cases, jealousy is included under the Selfish trait. Thus when someone acts jealous, he may get a check for Selfish._

> **Famous Characters**: King Arthur and Queen Guenever are revered for their generosity. 
 
### Honest/Deceitful
To be honest is to deal truthfully with others, both in matters of import or triviality, no matter what the
consequences. Persons of extreme honesty are said to have integrity and to be trustworthy, scrupulous, and reliable.

A deceitful person is generally likely to distort truths, or to fabricate untruths, for his own ends (or perhaps on
behalf of others) — or in some cases, simply for the sake of doing so. Chronically deceitful people are called liars,
frauds, and false-hearted.

### Modest/Proud
To be modest is to be quiet and reserved about one's gifts and accomplishments, not seeking excessive attention in the
recitation of one's own deeds. A modest character is glad simply to perform deeds, rather than bask in the repeated
glory of hearing about them. Very modest people are called humble and reserved, or perhaps even shy.

The Proud trait indicates the degree to which one gets pleasure from hearing and/or boasting of his deeds. Both
Germanic and Pagan ways value Pride in a character. Excessive pride implies arrogance, and likely a boastful nature.

> **Famous Characters**: Sir Turquine, the feared Saxon knight, is notorious for his great pride.

### Just/Arbitrary
A just character is capable of telling what is right and wrong (within the mores of his upbringing and his personal
beliefs), and is desirous of passing due judgment based on that information. A very just person is called fair and
impartial.

Arbitrary means that the character has no concern for what is right or wrong, and uses other information and bases
for his decision making. Very arbitrary people are labeled unjust, unfair, wrongful, and probably biased and partial.

> **Famous Characters**: King Arthur is perhaps most famous for his extraordinary sense of justice.

### Merciful/Cruel
Mercy indicates a tendency to extend sympathy, pity, and aid to others. This includes sparing an enemy, giving money to
the poor, helping the weak, and any other act that is not expected of one's rank and station. A very merciful person is
called compassionate.

Cruel indicates a disregard for the feelings and needs of others, or lack of sympathy. High values in Cruel indicate
that the character actually enjoys the discomforts and troubles of others.

### Pious/Worldly
A pious character often dwells on spiritual matters, and is aware of them and their implications in the material world.
(This is not the same as worship, which is an action rather than a belief.) A pious person is a spiritual person.
An extremely pious person is devout or zealous, perhaps even saintly.

Worldly indicates a disregard or disbelief in the spiritual side of life. Extreme values might indicate blasphemy and
sacrilege. Alternatively, it might just indicate profligacy, taking great pleasure in temporal things such as fine
clothes, comfortable furnishings, good music and poetry, and the best company.

Do not confuse Worldly with Indulgent; the two often go hand-in-hand, but they are not the same.

> **Famous Characters**: Sir Galahad is the most pious knight in King Arthur's realm.

### Prudent/Reckless
The prudent character gives thought to what he does before he acts. Such a character is called cautious, and excessively
prudent people are called shrewd, circumspect, or discerning — or "slow to act."

The reckless character acts before he thinks things through, without concern for anything but the immediate consequences.
Almost any time someone gets a check for acting according to a passion, they will have acted rashly. An extremely
reckless character is called careless, or a hothead.

> **Famous Characters**: Sagramore le Desirious is decidedly rash, while Sir Dinadan is noted for being prudent.

### Temperate/Indulgent
Temperance means that a character takes only what he needs of food, drink, and other temporal needs. He is frugal and
abstains from excess. Extreme temperance indicates asceticism, perhaps even self-mortification.

An indulgent character is a gourmand: He takes pleasure in food and drink, both in quality and quantity. Extremes of
this indicate gluttony and drunkenness.

### Trusting/Suspicious
One who is trusting tends to believe information without any inclination to suspect its falsity. An excessively trusting
person is gullible and credulous, perhaps even a dupe.

Suspicious indicates that a person is unlikely to believe what he hears unless proof is offered. An extremely suspicious
person is called a skeptic or a doubter. A naturally suspicious person might still be extremely pious, however.

> _Note: In some cases, jealousy is included under the Suspicious trait. Thus when someone acts jealous, he may get a
check for Suspicious._

> **Famous Characters**: Sir Mordred is noted for his suspicious and skeptical behavior.

### Valorous/Cowardly
To be valorous means to be brave and courageous, willing to place oneself in danger for the sake of victory, friends, 
or the simple love of battle. Normal knights are valorous, and thus might be referred to as doughty, stalwart, or valiant. 
Extremely heroic individuals are often called fearless or intrepid. Valor may be exhibited not only in combat, but 
whenever risks to one's health or wellbeing are involved.

Cowardly means to be fearful of pain and of harm to one's self. Someone who is extremely faint-hearted is labeled as a 
poltroon, dastard, craven, caitiff, or recreant.

> **Famous Characters**: Sir Lancelot and Sir Lamorak are well known as the most valorous knights in Britain. 

# Passions
Passions are strong emotional and psychological propensities within any individual. These include Love, Hate, Loyalty,
Envy, and Honor, among others. Beginning characters all begin with five passions: Loyalty (to their lord), Love
(of family), Hospitality, Honor, and Hate (of Saxons).

Passions are strong personal emotions, including religion, love, hate, amor, loyalty, envy, and anything else that
the Gamemaster admits into the game. These passions provide a method of measuring a character's inner self. They help
the character follow the morals of his age, and let him benefit from being a notable example of proper (or improper)
behavior.

Passionate characters may perform with superhuman effort and a greater likelihood of success. However, passionate
characters are volatile and moody — their feelings may change instantly due to success or failure on a passion roll. 
Based on the success or failure of a passion roll, they are likely to be found in any one of several states of mind 
which are not found among dispassionate folk: inspiration, introspection, melancholy, shock, and even madness (all 
have effects in game terms, as described below).

## Using Passions
Invoking a passion is a good way for the Gamemaster to add excitement to a scenario. However, passion rolls are a
risky business for players. The results vary, but are likely to be dramatic.

The Gamemaster may call for a passion roll, possibly with a modifier for the particular situation. This roll is handled
as any other unopposed resolution (see Chapter 5), but uses the results found on Table 4–2: Standard Passion Results.

At other times the player may request a roll, with the Gamemaster's approval. Remember that the Gamemaster has final 
word on the appropriateness of attempting to use a passion for inspiration. Players are warned that passion rolls can
be extremely risky as well as rewarding, for they may subject a knight to several unusual states of mind, including
introspection, melancholy, and madness.

### Standard Passion Roll Results

Roll Result | Effect
----------- | ------
Critical Success | Character is inspired (see below) and acts strongly in accordance with the passion. Gain 1 point in the passion, plus an experience check (see [Obtaining Experience](#obtaining-experience)).
Success | Character is [Inspired](#inspired) and acts in accordance with the passion. Gain an experience check in the passion.
Failure | Character is [Disheartened](#disheartened) and immediately loses 1 point in the relevant passion unless the Gamemaster rules otherwise.
Fumble | Character is [Maddened](#maddened) and immediately loses 1 point in the passion.

#### Inspired
To be inspired is to have achieved the highest state of passion. Inspiration can turn an ordinary character into an
extraordinary one; it is the source for the greatness that many Round Table knights often exhibit.

An inspired character gains tremendous ability for a time. The player may choose any one skill or combat skill: His
character's value in that skill is modified as shown on the chart below, based upon whether he was inspired by a success
or a critical success in his passion roll.

Inspired By... | Benefit
-------------- | -------
Critical Success | Doubled or gains +20 modifier (whichever is higher)
Success | Gain +10 modifier

This inspiration lasts for the length of the task at hand, but never for more than one full day.

##### Shock
If a knight should somehow fail to perform a deed for which he was inspired, he suffers shock. In game terms, the
character must immediately make an [aging roll](#step-3-aging).

> _Note: The Gamemaster may impose shock on characters (with or without their first being inspired) in other appropriate 
situations as well. Likely circumstances for imposing such a state might be after the knight has just abandoned a 
lord or a lover to grave danger or a dire fate._

#### Disheartened
A disheartened knight suffers a –5 modifier on all further rolls made during the situation that brought on his state.
Once the situation passes, he then becomes [Melancholic](#melancholic).

##### Melancholic
Melancholy is a mental disorder that, when it manifests, causes the victim to be overwhelmed by grief. He or she may
fall to the ground weeping aloud, lamenting losses and ill luck, and crying out from deep emotional pain. Alternately,
a melancholic character might fall into a deep and morose depression.

If a melancholic knight is disturbed by another man, he falls into an maniacal rage, hoping to overcome his misery
through violence; he always attacks the disturbing individual unless it is a woman. The only way a man can hope to
calm a melancholic knight is by using "reverse psychology": The would-be healer must first succeed at an unopposed roll
using a trait of his choice. If he fails the roll, he fails to penetrate the victim's melancholy using that trait. He
may try again using a different trait.

Once the healer succeeds at a trait roll, he provokes an opposed roll from the victim on the opposite trait. (He is
assumed to have addressed the melancholic victim in such a way that he provokes a response.) If the melancholic
character's roll wins the resolution, he attacks, but if he loses he calms down and, a short time later, goes to
sleep. On a tie, the characters do what their players wish them to do.

In game terms, a bout of melancholia usually lasts for one full day.

#### Maddened
A character may be driven mad by his passions. This madness may occur at once, or once the relevant action is over 
(at the Gamemaster's discretion). Once madness sets in, the player must immediately give his character sheet to the 
Gamemaster, who describes what ensues based only on what the other player characters know and can perceive.

Normally, mad characters run away immediately. For the duration of their madness, they attempt to avoid the scene of 
their disastrous experience at all cost. A madman is out of play until the Gamemaster wishes to reintroduce him into 
the campaign — which may be years later, or perhaps never. Storytelling considerations should be dominant in 
determining how long a maddened character is gone.

If recovered, the madman will have undergone unusual, unknown circumstances that can result in changes to some 
attributes and/or skills, at the Gamemaster's option. Players should simply accept these changes, which may not always 
be negative.

The character's player remains unaware of precisely what has transpired while the character was in the Gamemaster's 
hands. However, once returned, a character may seek out knowledge of his actions while maddened, and by that means 
eventually determine where he went and what happened to him during his period of madness.

## Starting Passions
Passion | Starting Value
------- | --------------
Loyalty (lord) | 15
Love (family) | 15
Hospitality | 15
Honor | 15
Hate (Saxons) | Roll 3d6

Once these values are assigned, a player may (but need not) raise one or more of her character's passions by
distributing up to 3 points among them. See [Chapter 4 for more information on passions](#LiNK-ME).

## Types of Passions
The Gamemaster might allow other passions for a character by at the start, and characters acquire passions as the result
of game play. The core passions are listed below:

### Loyalty (Lord)
Loyalty is the prime virtue of the medieval world — without it, the feudal system could not exist. Most knights believe
in "King before God," no matter what the priests tell them. Showing obedience is correct behavior, and disobedience to a
lord is shocking to all true knights

All knights must be knighted by someone, and the "Loyalty (Lord)" space on your character sheet is used for his loyalty
to that initial lord. The starting Loyalty (lord) value is 15 for vassal knights (and thus the default for player characters).

If the Gamemaster permits the play of a household knight with an assured household but no land, like Sir Ambrut, then
roll 2d6+6 for his Loyalty (lord) passion. If a player runs a homeless knight, his Loyalty to whoever knighted him is
only 2d6.

As the game progresses, though, a knight may later acquire other lands, though, and therefore other lords as well.
The typical Loyalty (lord) value for a new lord (other than the one who knighted you) is 3d6.

The following modifiers are common to these loyalties:

Circumstance | Modifier
------------ | --------
Manor(s) granted | +1d3 per manor
Rich estate(s) granted | +1 per $1 of annual income

### Love (of family)
Love of family is a natural emotion common to humankind in any age. The travel restrictions of the medieval era were
severe, which reinforced family closeness. Serfs almost never traveled more than a day's walk from their birthplace.
Noblewomen were fortunate to travel across the country once a year. Thus, turning to one's kin for help was the
universal answer to any problem.

In character generation, new characters, who are by default eldest sons and thus destined to be the heads of their
immediate families, start with a powerful love for their family: A character's starting Love (family) value is equal to
15 for eldest sons. This default value is similar for all daughters of a household. 

However, less fortunate younger sons, often sent from the hearth, were more likely to find fault with their kin, and so 
expressed less loyalty to them. The second son gets a Love (family) value equal to 2d6+5; the third son, 2d6+4; the 
4th, 2d6+3; 5th, 2d6+2; 6th, 2d6+1; and 7th and any others 2d6. Other modifiers to the starting value may apply. 

### Hospitality
This passion measures how much your character respects the time-honored institution of hospitality. In cases of great 
passion (16 or higher), a proponent of this practice might feel bound to correct others' inhospitable behavior, and 
perhaps even to seek out and destroy those who break the rules of hospitality. On the other hand, anyone with a 
disregard for hospitality (less than 5) is likely to steal without compunction.

Whenever a character's behavior warrants it, the Hospitality statistic should be altered. If a character goes lurking 
and spying around in someone's castle, especially if he actually robs it of goods, he should lose at least 1 
Hospitality point immediately for breaking the rules of hospitality.

Similarly, if a character rises to defend the hospitality of someone else, he should get a check 
(see [Obtaining Experience](#obtaining-experience)) — especially if he defends the hospitality of someone for whom he 
really doesn't much care, or if he holds his own anger or hatred in check for the sake of another's hospitality.
(No check is given to someone defending his own home.)

All characters from the Cymric culture start with a Hospitality value of 15. 

### Fey Passion
When mortal knights become too exposed to the fantastic sights and sounds of Faerie, they often find that the mundane
world begins to pale for them. After a knight has wooed the King of Elfland's Daughter, mortal women seem dull and 
coarse by contrast. Experiencing the delights of King Today’s court makes Baron Guelph’s castle seem like the hovel of 
a surly, ill-mannered peasant. This malaise can affect every aspect of the knight’s life, sometimes leading to a 
premature death. Such knights are referred to as "fey," for they seem more like elves than men.  

Fey is first generated when a knight undergoes a traumatic experience that involves Faerie in some way: This could an 
encounter with a hideous monster, a dalliance with an elf-maid that turns serious, or simply journeying to the Faerie 
realms.

Note that falling in love with a Faerie, and thus acquiring either an Amor or Love (faerie lover), should gain a Fey 
passion as well, equal in value to the Amor or Love stat.

Otherwise, the starting Fey passion is 2d6 plus any modifiers from the chart below. 

Situation | Modifier
--------- | --------
Traveled to Faerie realm | +3
Traveled to Faerie place (dell, mound, woods, etc.) | +2 
Subjected to a powerful Faerie magic or effect | +3
Witness to a powerful Faerie magic or effect | +2
Significant or continuous interaction with Faerie beings | +1
Ate Faerie food in Faerie place | +2

The Fey passion uses the same mechanics as other passions, with a few important distinctions and effects: 

#### Creativity
The passion may always be used for inspiration while engaged in creative acts, like reciting or writing poetry, singing, 
and playing an instrument. In fact, many bards and poets wish to become Fey, just for this very reason.

#### Return
The Fey passion can be used for inspiration to any skill used in returning to the situation that created the passion. 
That is, if Sir Ambrose gained Fey by traveling through Arcadia, he can use inspiration from Fey to add to skills that 
would allow him to get back to Arcadia, such as weapon skills when fighting threshold foes, or to personality traits 
when undergoing behavior tests to enter Arcadia. 

#### Ennui
Whenever another passion roll is successful, such as Loyalty (lord) or Love (family), the player knight must immediately
contest his Fey against the successful passion. If Fey wins the contest, then the knight does not gain the benefit of 
inspiration from the original Passion. 

#### Accelerated Aging
A knight must make an additional aging roll every year, even if he does not normally have to make one for some reason. 

### Honor
Honor is the passion that sets knights apart from ordinary people. It is a combination of personal dignity, integrity,
and pride. Personal honor is not always a slippery issue. The Dishonorable Acts table, below, lists a number of things
upon which everyone can agree as being dishonorable actions for a knight. Performing these deeds clearly and invariably
diminishes honor — this is the code of knighthood to which knights have agreed.

#### Dishonorable Acts
Act | Honor Lost
--- | ----------
Attacking an unarmed knight | -1
Cowardice | -1
Desertion from battle or military service | -1
Plundering a holy place of your religion | -1
Killing an unarmed holy person of your religion | -2
Killing, kidnapping, or raping a noblewoman | -2
Lending money at a profit | -2
Performing physical labor | -2
Breaking an oath | -3
Flagrant cowardice | -3
Treachery against a member of your family | -5
Treason (against your lord) | -5
Killing a kinsman | -6
Learning to cast magical spells | -8

However, beyond the acts listed on Table 4–3, disagreement may arise as to what is or is not honorable, often because 
the honor of an action is personal rather than social.

The term "personal honor" is used carefully to separate such honor from other sworn or understood social obligations, 
including issues or behaviors covered by other passions. Thus, it is not possible for a knight to have his personal 
honor abused if someone insults his family — one's Love (family) passion covers that. Likewise, someone insulting 
one's lover should involve the Amor passion, not Honor.

But Honor can still cover many other things. In fact, it can include almost anything that a character chooses to 
include. Someone with an extremely high honor may be offended by anything that anyone says that he does not like. 
Rationality may have little if any bearing.

Honor is tied to traits more deeply than other passions usually are. The "integrity" component of Honor, for instance, 
is closely linked to the trait of Honest, while "pride" is obviously linked with the Proud trait. Thus, a knight might
be required to make a Proud trait roll by the Gamemaster and, upon losing, the player might then invoke the Honor 
passion (rather than the Modest trait) to help him through the event.

A dishonorable character suffers considerably in Arthurian society. He loses the trust of those about him, and in 
committing dishonorable acts probably incurs various punishments — monetary fines, banishment, forfeiture, blood feud,
etc. These social troubles are further reflected by rules concerning this passion.

Whenever a character's Honor is reduced to 4 or lower, he has proved himself unfit to bear the title of knight and 
serve a lord. His lord must either outlaw him or degrade him (i.e., strip him of knighthood). To fail to do so places
the lord's own status in jeopardy because he would be failing to uphold his own governance. Honor may eventually be 
regained at this grim point in a character's career.

If a character's Honor ever reaches 0, the player must remove that character from active play. Recovery from such a 
low state is simply not possible. If the player wishes to see him in the campaign, he must turn the character sheet 
over to the Gamemaster, who can play him as a Gamemaster character if he wishes.

A character's starting Honor value is 15.

### Hatred (of Saxons)
By default, hatred of the Saxons is an inherited passion of all starting characters. The depredations of these
foreigners have reached everyone in Britain. Characters begin with a Hate (Saxons) value of 3d6.

### Fear (Creature or Event)
Fear is a negative emotion that can possibly be inherited as a family curse, but is normally gained only through a
character’s personal experience. Fear is an irrational and absolute, mindless state of panic. Only extraordinary
adventures can instill such terror in knight characters (lesser characters may be more vulnerable). Such fear usually
stems from supernatural places or creatures.

Of course, a Fear passion is often wisdom in disguise, as many supernatural creatures and natural phenomena are
immensely powerful and can cause only harm to humans. Some sample fears might apply to for hags, sailing, sea monsters,
crazed holy men, standing stones that move, or Picts in the wild.

> _Note: Fears, unlike other passions, never give benefits; they are an exception to the normal passion rules. No Glory
is gained from a success or a critical success on a Fear roll, and no inspiration is possible. A Fear passion serves
only to place the character out of the player’s control (or at least to drastically limit his actions) during specific
situations._

> **Special**: The Gamemaster may create an opportunity to overcome a Fear passion. Such a chance should probably come
only once in any character’s career, and if the character succeeds in overcoming his Fear, he may gain Glory for it —
about ten times the value of the character’s former Fear value is appropriate.

### Hate (Nation, Group, or Person)
Hatred motivates many people in Pendragon, especially poltroons who are driven to dastardly deeds. For instance, King
Mark assuredly hates Tristram, and Morgan le Fay hates Guenever. Even some of the protagonists develop hatreds, usually
because of their Love (family) or other loyalties. The best instance is Gawaine’s unrelenting Hate (Lancelot), brought
about by Lancelot’s slaying of Gareth, Gawaine’s beloved brother.

Hatred may be for an individual, a people, a kingdom, a religion, for magicians or monks, a station or class, or
whatever the Gamemaster agrees to.

Starting Hate values are up to the Gamemaster, but should have a value of at least 10. The exact Hate value should be
based on the event that provoked the passion.

### Loyalty (Pendragon)
Likely, only a few characters will ever become direct vassals of the High King. The typical Loyalty (Pendragon) value is 2d6+6.

Circumstance | Modifier
Your father was killed fighting against a Pendragon | -1d6
You are socially conservative | -1d6
You already have the Hate (Pendragon) passion | Subtract value of the Hate (Pendragon) passion
Your liege lord has the Hate (Pendragon) passion | Subtract value of the lord's Hate (Pendragon) passion

### Loyalty (Vassals)
Feudalism calls for mutual loyalty between vassals and lord. Most knights never gain other knights as vassals and thus
have no need for this passion. However, any knight who does gain the vassalage of other knights should also gain this
trait, which might be used, for instance, to determine whether the lord will ransom his vassals. Other game uses will
inevitably come up.

The typical starting Loyalty (Vassals) value is 2d6+6.

### Loyalty (Group)
Knights may join or even form fellowships. (The name of the fellowship replaces the word "group" in the name of the
passion.) The typical Loyalty (group) value for a new group is 3d6.

Circumstance | Modifier
------------ | --------
Members are all kinsmen or from the same kingdom | +6
Members are all of same general culture | +1d6
Members knew each other previously | Varies (as appropriate)

### Love (Person, Group, or God)
Love is an emotional bonding or attraction felt by one individual for another individual, group, or deity. A character
may have many loves, but it is best if only one counts for Glory points each year (normally the highest).

#### Love (Deity)
This passion is required of all Christian clergy. The cynical nature of many clergymen proves that this passion does
not have to be high to join the church, but it is a requirement nonetheless. Religiously oriented knights may also
have this passion.

A critical success in this passion gives the character a modifier or a check to all appropriate religious traits, not
to any one skill. The character is thereafter incapacitated by an ecstatic vision for a period of time determined by
the Gamemaster (at least 1 hour), and cannot act at all during that time.

The typical Love (deity) value is equal to that character’s starting Pious trait value.

#### Love (Spouse)
Deep feeling and attraction for one’s husband or wife was apparently quite uncommon in the feudal world of arranged
marriages, but not entirely absent. Two significant exceptions in the romances are the loves of Duke Gorlois for his
wife Ygraine and of Arthur for his wife, Guenever.

The typical Loyalty (spouse) value is 3d6.

# Glory
Any dramatic pattern of behavior gains Glory. As a result, characters with interesting personalities gain more Glory
than those without. However, behavior in accordance with society's ideals still gains more Glory than actions arising
from one's idiosyncrasies or peculiarities. Thus, Gawaine gains much more Glory for his chivalrous nature than Agravaine
gains from his streak of cruelty.

# Obtaining Experience
Every skill, trait, or passion that can change as a result of learning is marked on the character sheet by having a box
(❏) near it. This box is checked (✓) when the character gains significant experience during an adventure with a skill,
trait, or passion. Statistics do not change immediately as a result of this experience, though annual training may
increase them.

## Experience From Skills
There are times during play when the Gamemaster tells the player to check one of his character's skills
(under ["Skills" or "Combat Skills" on the sheet](#LiNK-ME)). This means that the character has successfully used
that skill in a time of crisis and may, at a future time, learn from the experience.

A box may be checked only when the Gamemaster says the player may do so. The mark reminds the player to check the
skill later, during the Winter Phase, to see if any learning occurred.

Experience checks for skills are intended to be very difficult to gain, and are not automatic whenever a success is
achieved. Gamemasters must explain this point to the players. The ability to award or deny an experience check is one
of the key powers of the Gamemaster.

Note that a squire's skills may increase in the same manner as a player knight's skills.  A check for a skill is
possible only if at least one of the following two statements pertains:

1. A critical success is achieved. if a character does his best possible, learning is likely.
1. A success in a significant situation is achieved. Even a dozen successful attacks on a gang of poorly armed peasant
levies would not be justification for a check to a weapon skill, since no real risk or challenge was incurred by the
attacker, and nothing important was achieved by their defeat.

## Experience From Traits and Passions
As with skills, there are times during play when the Gamemaster tells a player to check one of his character's traits
or passions. This means that the character has displayed significant behavior in accordance with that trait. This
action or behavior does not necessarily have to be observed by other characters or players.

if the rules for traits or passions request a roll, this means that your character might learn something, if he acts or
feels the right way. But his actions are not yet clear, or significant enough. A successful roll means he might get the
check, too.

## Results of Experience Checks
When a character has a check next to a skill, trait, or passion, the player must make an experience roll during the
[Winter Phase](#LiNK-ME). if the roll is successful, the checked value increases by 1 point. Experience rolls may bring
skills over 20, with luck.

# Skills
Character advancement in Pendragon is measured in part by the increase of your character’s skills. Skills express the 
social and physical activities popular in the Arthurian mythos. No knight is expected to master all or most of the 
possible skills.

## Improving Skills
Your character sheet lists every skill and combat skill common to the Cymric culture. Non-standard weapon skills like 
Great Axe are not printed, and all such skills are assumed to start with a value of 0.

The blanks on the character sheet permit you to write in ordinary skills of your own devising, or special skills from 
later Pendragon supplements. The blanks under combat skills permit you to write in the non-standard weapon skills of 
your choice.

Starting values may be altered during Character Generation, and skills can be increased in many ways as the game 
progresses. Within the setting of the game, a character may raise a skill value by training with a teacher, by diligent 
practice on his own, by first-hand experience in the field, by means of a major increase in self-confidence and reputation, 
or by magic.

All of these improvements, save those introduced by magic, occur during the [Winter Phase](#winter-phase). The Gamemaster
handles any magical skill increases that might occur during his scenarios, based on the rules for magic that will appear 
in future game supplements.

Part of the fun in the game is seeing your character increase in skill. Most players focus on a half-dozen or fewer 
skills that they increase through the methods listed above, over several decades of game time. Using training and 
practice, these skills are gradually raised to a value of 20. Thereafter, experience checks 
(see [Obtaining Experience](#obtaining-experience)) and Glory can raise each skill into the realm of truly heroic mastery.

## Skill Categories
Skills are divided into two broad categories: ordinary skills (normally referred to as simply "skills"), which include a
wide range of different practical proficiencies and areas of knowledge, and combat skills, the crucial military skills
that are the traditional area of expertise for knights. The two categories are listed in two separate areas on the
knight’s character sheet, and are described in separate sections below.

### Knight
Certain skills are noted as being Knightly in nature. These are accepted as being compatible with the duties of knighthood.
Characters who are not knights may also use these skills; for instance, a common huntsman should have a decent Awareness skill.

### Knowledge
Some skills are noted as being Knowledge skills. These include knowledge normally associated with social classes, such as
Courtesy (noble customs), Folklore (peasant customs), and Religion (clerical customs); or with specialized practices,
such as Romance or Tourney. These are bodies of information that require special knowledge to execute properly.

Each knowledge skill includes the what, when, where, why, and how of these activities or areas of expertise. Success in
a knowledge skill does not always indicate that the knight did something, but that he knew, intuited, or recognized
something important or useful.

### Non-Knight
Non-Knightly skills are those often used in the game, but not by knights. The best example is Industry (used in artistry
and artisanship), which is normal for women, tradesmen, and peasants, but will surely cost a knight his title if he
engages in it. Characters destined for knighthood begin with — and generally maintain — a value of 0 in these skills.

## Success or Failure
Success or failure with skills is resolved using the normal resolution rolls (see Chapter 5). Some skills are used only 
in unopposed resolution, while others are normally used in opposition against other characters, in contests or challenges. 
Modifiers may be applied to any of these resolutions.

The results of a critical success or fumble with an ordinary skill, when significant, are given in the individual skill 
descriptions below. Otherwise, the Gamemaster describes the results based on the situation.

The [Combat Skills](#combat-skills) section gives the results of criticals and fumbles for combat skills.

## Honor
The Honor passion reflects your character’s code of behavior and his reputation as a knight. Fumbled or failed skill 
rolls do not affect your character’s Honor value: Honor cannot be lost simply because of a bad skill roll.

Certain situations might occur, however, in which a Gamemaster feels justified in subtracting Honor because a skill was 
used unwisely or unjustly. For example, causing harm or humiliation to another character through failure in a skill 
might incur the loss of 1 point of Honor (or, in particularly severe cases, more) — especially if another character 
with a higher value in that skill was available to attempt the task, yet the character who failed insisted on taking
responsibility for the task anyway. The Gamemaster is always the final arbiter in such difficult situations.

## Skill Descriptions
Descriptions of, you know, skills.

### Awareness (Knightly)
Use this skill when a knight is listening for a sound, trying to spot a hidden Pict or discern some other hidden danger,
or otherwise draw some sensory information from his surroundings.

This skill measures the character’s attentiveness to his immediate surroundings, using both his five physical senses and
the mysterious "sixth sense." A critical success might reveal extra information (such as the precise location of the
bandits hiding in the trees, as opposed to the simple realization that there are bandits there), while a fumbled
Awareness roll reveals incorrect information.

A success that reveals an ambush or other such crucial information may be worth Glory, at the Gamemaster’s option.

### Boating (Knightly)
This skill allows a character to handle watercraft, whether a rowboat, a skiff, a coracle, or a Saxon longship. Success 
indicates that the boat did what it was supposed to do. In calm waters, Boating is unmodified, but during storms or 
floods, modifiers may be assigned.

A success with the Boating skill can gain the character Glory if lives were saved thereby.

### Chirurgery (Non-Knightly)
This ancient practice of healing includes much useful knowledge, such as herbal medicine and bone setting. It also
includes superstition, prayer, and generous heaps of misinformation. Thus, its use is fraught with uncertainty.
Chirurgery (pronounced approximately "KY-rir-jur-ee") does little to heal the patient directly, but is a process that
seeks only to keep the patient alive so that the natural healing processes of the body may take effect.

Chirurgery is a most important skill for women, though many priests and monks also know it. However, it is not the duty
of a knight to learn this skill, and most knights would feel highly uncomfortable performing a skill associated with women.

Badly wounded, ill, or debilitated characters often require application of the Chirurgery skill. If your character needs
Chirurgery, for whatever reason, the Gamemaster tells you to check the box on the character sheet entitled "Chirurgery Needed."

Glory should always be gained for successful use of the Chirurgery skill. The amount gained can be increased in
proportion to the Glory or rank of the character being treated if the Gamemaster feels this is appropriate. More
 Glory should be gained if a life was saved thereby.

See [Injury and Health"](#injury-and-health) in for more information on the complicated processes of chirurgery and healing.

### Compose (Knightly)
This skill grants the user a chance to create original musical works for voice or for one or more medieval instruments.
The quality of the piece composed is relative to the number rolled for the success. The composer’s ability to perform his
work is limited by his Play (instrument) and Singing skills, as appropriate.

A critical success indicates that the piece created has great beauty, quality of rhyme and emotion, originality, and
perhaps spontaneity. A piece of this quality might bring a listener to tears, or even more.

A fumble indicates an embarrassingly bad piece.

The Gamemaster may award Glory to a successful composer, particularly if the song is dedicated to a lady.

### Courtesy (Knightly, Knowledge)
Courtesy is a knowledge skill defining a knight’s knowledge of courtly manners, from etiquette to matters of precedence
and table manners; from modes of speech, including protocol, vocabulary, style, and forms of address, to all types of
decorum appropriate to a lord’s court, such as around superiors, around women, and around disfavored people.

The default starting Courtesy value of 3 indicates that the character understands simple matters of precedence and knows
the basic forms of address at court. Courtesy does not include dance, heraldry, or forms of the tournament. These areas
of expertise are so complicated that they are treated as separate skills.

A successful Courtesy roll means that the knight performed correctly in the formal manner appropriate to the relative
situation, making a suitable impression upon his audience. Courtesy is inappropriate for use with commoners.

A critical success indicates great elegance and style in the performance. A fumble indicates that a silly or even
offensive act occurred, with consequent humiliation. Haughty or cruel lords may become insulted and angry at characters
who fumble their Courtesy roll in court, possibly with dramatic consequences.

Glory may be gained by any significant use of Courtesy in court or any formal situation, particularly with a critical
success.

> **Special**: With the Gamemaster’s approval, characters having high Glory may receive a positive modifier to Courtesy,
with a maximum modifier equal to Glory/1,000.

### Dancing (Knightly)
This skill measures the character’s ability to move gracefully to music, as well as his knowledge of the many styles of
formal dancing done at court. This elegant style of dancing depends primarily on experience and knowledge of forms rather
than on agility.

A success indicates accurate adherence to the accepted form of the dance being performed, while a critical success
indicates superb grace, verve, and perhaps spontaneity

A fumble means that the character went the wrong way, probably bumping into other dancers. The Gamemaster may even rule
that the fumbler tripped and fell over his own feet. A fumbled Dance roll is invariably a humiliating experience.

Glory can be gained from successful Dance rolls if the dancer(s) are the center of attention.

> **Special**: With the Gamemaster’s approval, characters having high Glory may receive a positive modifier to Dance,
with a maximum modifier equal to Glory/1,000.

# Stats

## Dexterity Roll
Game play presents countless hazards and difficulties that challenge your player knight’s agility, reactions, or
movement-related abilities such as climbing, sneaking, and balancing. All these situations use a DEX roll, usually
unopposed, to determine success.

The Gamemaster may find other occasions to use the DEX roll as well.

> **Critical Successes and Fumbles**: As with most attribute rolls, success and failure are usually the only possible
results of a DEX roll — neither a critical success nor a fumble gives any special result

However, several special uses of the DEX roll, such as brawling and sneaking, are an exception to this pattern.
Furthermore, the Gamemaster may allow critical success or failure in a particular situation: If storytelling is enhanced,
by all means let a critical DEX success gain some extra benefit, or a fumble extract a special penalty.

> **Modifiers**: Many situations in which the DEX roll is used require negative modifiers. A few usages gain positive
modifiers. Each particular use of the DEX roll below lists specific suggestions for modifiers in addition to the general
points given here. Modifiers from sources such as Passions apply to DEX rolls, as they do to all rolls. In borderline
situations, the Gamemaster decides whether a modifier to DEX is appropriate.

For actions involving agility or movement, such as climbing or dodging, DEX is reduced by encumbrance, as shown on the chart below.

Encumbrance | DEX Modifier
----------- | ------------
Light load | -5
Heavy load | -10

> _In addition, armor penalizes DEX rolls, as shown in Table 6–1: Armor._

Cumulative modifiers may be applied to DEX rolls. For example, an climber attempting to clamber up a slope in leather 
armor while carrying a wounded knight on his back might suffer a –15 penalty or even worse to DEX. Realistically, 
certain feats are virtually (if not actually) impossible, and a negative modifier should support this.

### Balance
The balance roll is one of the most common types of DEX roll. Whenever an unmounted character receives a Knockdown result 
in combat (see Chapter 6), he must make a DEX roll to remain upright. Balance might also be tested when a character 
wishes to cross a narrow bridge, stay afoot on the heaving deck of a ship, or stay upright when the earth shakes from 
magic.

Encumbrance is not used to modify a DEX roll for balance unless the Gamemaster decides that it should, based on the 
circumstances. However, difficult footing may impose a negative modifier as usual.

If the balance roll is successful, the character remains upright; if not, he falls down. A critical success on a balance 
roll gains no special advantage unless the situation presents an obvious extra benefit. A fumble does no further harm than 
a failure, though, either.

Once knocked down, a character needs no roll to get up again, even if in heavy armor. However, in combat he must fight 
from a disadvantage while clambering back to his feet: He suffers a –5 modifier to his weapon skills, while any opponents 
gain a +5 modifier. See the “Combat” chapter  for more information on the complicated issues of combat modifiers and 
actions during a melee round. Footing: Most balance rolls should receive a negative modifier when attempted upon rough, 
narrow, or unstable surfaces, as appropriate. For example, a character attempting to balance as he walks across on a 
narrow wooden beam over a chasm should receive a penalty. Usually, this negative modifier should be no more than –10.

### Climb
A character may attempt to clamber up a surface using a DEX roll. If it is a relatively easy climb, such as up a sand
dune, the DEX roll might be made without modification, if required at all. Otherwise, a modifier is applied, as shown below.

Slope | DEX Modifier
----- | ------------
Tough climb (eg. rough vertical wall) | -5
Difficult climb (eg. smooth vertical wall | -10

> _Ropes or convenient vines may add to the chance of success. A rope gives a +5 modifier, while a proper ladder gives a 
+10 modifier. Siege ladders, which may have suffered hasty construction or damage from usage or defenders, grant a 
modifier of +5 to +10 (1d6+4)._

Encumbered characters (such as those wearing armor) while climbing also suffer the usual modifiers to DEX.

Normally, one DEX roll is made per 30 feet of height or fraction thereof. Therefore, a 65-foot tower would require three
successful DEX rolls to climb.

#### Slipperiness
Most climb rolls should receive a negative modifier for slippery surfaces, as appropriate. For example, a character 
attempting to climb a wet, moss-covered wall should receive a penalty. Usually, this negative modifier should be no 
more than –10

### Jump
A character may jump horizontally to cross a wide chasm or hole, or vertically up or down. Both types of jump require a
DEX roll. Encumbered characters who are jumping suffer the usual modifiers to DEX. As well, a jump may have a modifier for
difficulty assigned to it, based on the distance in yards. (This is intended to make certain jumps impossible, as they
should be.)

For simplicity’s sake, a jump’s distance imposes a –3 modifier per yard of distance beyond the first. For this purpose,
treat each fraction of a yard as a full yard. Assume that a horizontal leap also has a vertical component equal to half
its length, but this imposes no further penalty.

Thus, for example, a 1-yard-high wall imposes no modifier to DEX for jumping (most relatively fit people can jump that
high without much trouble), while a 7-foot-high wall imposes a –6 penalty to DEX (round to 3 yards, with a –3 penalty
for each yard beyond the first).

A 9-foot-wide ditch imposes a –6 penalty to DEX for characters trying to jump across, making the jump difficult, yet
possible for an agile character. A moat 22 feet across imposes a –21 modifier (round to 8 yards, with a –3 penalty for
each yard beyond the first) — it is simply too wide ever to jump, even for naked, screaming Picts.

Keep in mind that realism should always assert itself in these situations: No human can cleanly hurdle a 10-foot wall,
for example, even with a critical success, but a fit person can capably jump up and haul himself to the top.

### Sneak
Stealth and detection are complicated subjects, and the Gamemaster should be ready to adjust or augment the basic rules 
given here as needed.

If a character wishes to sneak up on someone, he makes a DEX roll. Any character who might reasonably have a chance to 
observe the character makes an opposed Awareness roll. (See “Opposed Rolls” in Chapter 5.) If both sneaker and observer 
fail their rolls, the Gamemaster should decide what happens based on the circumstances.

Unlike most DEX rolls, a critical success on a sneak roll has a distinct effect: It always succeeds unless the opponent
also achieves a critical, in which case a tie results, meaning that the sneaker moves forward, but the victim is alerted 
that something suspicious is going on. Conversely, a fumble while sneaking ensures detection.

Standard rules for encumbrance do not apply while sneaking: Instead, a character suffers only a –5 modifier for metal armor 
or a heavy load, and no penalty for sneaking in leather armor or with a light load.

Circumstances may provide modifiers to the DEX roll. For example, abundant cover or ambient noise might grant a +5 modifier 
(or even +10 if the benefit is substantial, such as a loud waterfall nearby or a sudden fire lighting the sky, accompanied 
by faint shouting from a different direction). Similarly, if the potential observer is engaged in an activity rather than 
devoting his attention to watching and listening for intruders, he should suffer a –5 or greater penalty on his Awareness 
roll.

### Throw
To have your character throw a rope to a drowning person or hurl a stunned enemy over the parapet, use a DEX roll. Success
indicates that the objective was achieved. The Gamemaster rules on the modifier, if any, that should be applied to the task.
Throwing a heavy object at a tiny target far away might suffer a –10 modifier, while a throw from the top of a wall at a
huge target below might gain a +10 modifier.

Encumbrance or footing does not normally hinder a throw unless the Gamemaster feels the circumstances warrant a negative
modifier.

#### Thrown Weapons
If damage is intended to a target, the Javelin skill might be used if it seems appropriate. However, if a character
wishes to heave a boulder from a cliff or hurl a stool at a nearby foe, for instance, he should make a DEX roll as if
it were a ranged combat skill; a successful attack roll deals damage as if with a brawling attack. (See both “Ranged
Attacks” and “Brawling” in Chapter 6.)

A critical success indicates that double damage is dealt, as with any attack, while a fumble might hit a nearby ally,
object, or surface instead of the intended target.

The maximum range for any object that may be hurled as a weapon should be decided by the Gamemaster, but should rarely
exceed 20 yards.

# Winter Phase
Winter is the time for rest, recuperation, and character growth. During this time, knights engage in training, amorous
pursuits, and gossip. In game terms, the players perform character updating.

Although most military activity stops for the winter, people still are active as they gather for feasts and holy days.
These meetings are of major importance; a lord often calls his vassals to feast at his castle, or travels through the
snow to visit each of them at their own holdings.

Thus, most of the wintertime is spent in socially oriented scenarios, if any at all. Gamemasters might wish to run more
typical scenarios during the winter; however, if so, they will have to rule as to whether the normal opportunities for
training are available during that same year, or lost due to the characters being in action instead.

## Step 1: Solo Scenarios
Your character may benefit from one or more "solo scenarios" (see Appendix 3). This is particularly important if you were 
absent for a play session and your knight thus missed the last game year of play. Later in the campaign, Romance may be 
done in secret, so romantic knights will wish to utilize this step. Check with the Gamemaster.

## Step 2: Experience Rolls
Characters spend some of the winter reflecting back over the year that has gone by. This process is simulated using an 
"experience roll." Throughout game play during the game’s summer season, potential improvements are recorded as an 
increase in the checked skill, passion, or trait value (see "[Obtaining Experience](#obtaining-experience)).

The experience roll process is the same whether you seek to increase a skill, a passion, or a trait. Attributes 
(STR, DEX, etc.) cannot be increased this way. Roll d20 once for each experience check you have on your character 
sheet. If the number rolled is greater than the current value, then the character learned from experience and adds 1 
point to that value. If the value is already at 20 or greater, a roll of 20 still boosts it by 1 point. Thus, a 
character with a checked Proud trait of 24 who received a 20 on the experience check roll would increase his Proud 
statistic to 25.

The process is repeated for every check on your sheet. Each skill gets only one check per year, but any number of 
skills may be checked. The number of successes achieved during play is not relevant: only one check can appear in any 
box. The player determines the order in which he rolls for checks.

If your primary squire has any checks, you may roll for each of his skills normally as well.

## Step 3: Aging
Increase your character’s age by one year. In game terms, all aging is done during the Winter Phase, regardless of your
character’s actual birth date. Your squire(s) also age at this point, and a player knight’s squire is always replaced
with a new 15-year-old squire upon reaching age 21.

Aging eventually takes even the most gifted character out of play, usually around age 50 or later. When any attribute,
even APP, reaches a value of 3 or less, the character is considered bedridden and may no longer participate in active
play. A bedridden character no longer receives Glory unless circumstances are truly unusual, but continues to age. He
may still give orders (which will probably be ignored), write a will, tell tales of his adventures, or take other
actions that the Gamemaster permits. When any attribute reaches 0, the character dies.

### Aging Procedure
Every character of 35 years of age or more must roll on [Statistics Lost](#statistics-lost) table: Aging each winter. The
ultimate result of aging may be a random reduction in one or more of the character’s statistics. For example, in a
given year, a character might lose 1 point of STR and 1 point of CON, or 2 points of SIZ. In many years of aging, no
statistics are lost at all; at worst, no more than 4 points can be lost in a single year’s aging.

Roll 2d6 and consult the table to find the number of statistics affected by aging this year. The result from the
[Aging Table](#aging-table) is the number of rolls you must then make on Table 5–3. For example, if the first roll is a
4, you must roll twice on Table 5–3.

#### Aging Table
2d6 Result | No. of Stats Affected
---------- | ---------------------
2 | 4
3 | 3
4 | 2
5 | 1
6 - 8 | 0
9 | 1
10 | 2
11 | 3
12 | 4

Rolling on the Statistics Lost table determines which statistic values, if any, are reduced by 1 point. For example, if 
the [Aging Table](#aging-table) tells you to roll three times on the following table, and all three results are 2s, then
your character loses 3 points of DEX. Note that a roll of 6 on the Statistics Lost table indicates that no statistic is
lost from that particular die roll.

A character may die as a result of rolling on this table if the result brings any statistic to 0.

### Statistics Lost

1d6 Result | Stat Reduced
---------- | ------------
1 | SIZ
2 | DEX
3 | STR
4 | CON
5 | APP
6 | No loss

When characters lose statistics from the [Aging Table](#aging-table) and [Statistics Lost](#statistics-lost) table,
whether as a result of aging or from some other source, various natural forces such as disease or inimical magic are
often blamed. Thus, for example, characters who suffer a loss of SIZ or STR may be said to have been "withered by the
Evil Eye" or afflicted with "elf stroke"; loss of APP is commonly ascribed to the "pox." A loss of DEX is commonly
referred to as "the palsy," while a loss of CON is likely attributed to "consumption."

## Step 4: Economic Circumstances
Every character must determine his situation as regards food, money, clothing, possessions, and holdings in consultation
with the Gamemaster. An overall grade of maintenance must be established for your character. See
[Standards of Living](#standards-of-living) to help make the appropriate determination.

Ask the Gamemaster if anything important has happened to your character’s lands and economic needs, keeping notes as
needed. Raids, unscheduled visits by a lord, or even faerie curses might reduce a knight’s economic circumstances,
forcing a reduction in his grade of maintenance, while a very good harvest might let a knight increase his grade of
maintenance.

Gifts given by the lord to the knight, if any, should also be determined now, and any plunder or other valuable items
gained during the last year should be evaluated for worth. (At this stage, buying and selling may be required to convert
goods into cash.) Gifts and plunder may be substantial enough that a vassal knight can maintain or even increase his
grade of maintenance, even though his lord has not directly provided for it.

Now, based on the results of the above considerations, the player knight is assigned to one of the standard grades of
maintenance. If nothing remarkable has occurred in terms of your character’s personal wealth, for good or ill, then your
character uses the same grade of maintenance, if any, that he had last year.

### Effects of Maintenance
Based on his grade of maintenance, as determined above, a knight incurs various modifiers to rolls in subsequent steps of
the Winter Phase. Keep track of these modifiers on a piece of scrap paper.

#### Impoverished
This is a disastrous economic state in which to find oneself, little better than the lot of a common peasant. No knight
should suffer such a state if any alternative is available and consistent with the dictates of loyalty and honor.

An Impoverished Knight suffers a –15 modifier on all rolls made during Step 5 and Step 6 of the Winter Phase, treating
rolls of 0 or less as 1s. Further, his armor suffers a permanent 1-point loss of reduction value (applicable every winter)
due to severe rust and neglect of proper repair and care. Finally, he must make a CON roll or lose 1 point of CON, as if
through aging, due to the hardships of having insufficient shelter.

However, even with all this to suffer, the knight loses no Glory, nor do his traits and passions change. The state of a
knight’s reputation is independent of such petty issues as money.

#### Poor
This grade of maintenance is unfortunate but not disastrous. Many vassal knights (most player characters) may suffer this
state for a year or two during their careers. Household knights have little control over their state of maintenance, and
may be kept at this level if they are greatly disfavored by their lord or if their lord has himself become poor.

The knight suffers a –3 modifier on all rolls made during Step 5 and on rolls on the Child Survival table during Step 6,
treating rolls of 0 or less as 1s; for each consecutive year that knight has been Impoverished or Poor, he suffers an
additional –3 modifier to these rolls, so that a knight who has been poor for 4 years suffers a –12 penalty. He also
suffers a –5 modifier to his roll on the Childbirth table in Step 6.

#### Ordinary
Household knights are almost always maintained at this level. In general, vassal knights (most player characters) are
capable only of maintaining themselves at this grade, unless they have gained wealth from plunder or ransoms.

No special effects or modifiers apply. All tables are rolled on normally.

#### Rich
Lord knights are usually expected to maintain themselves at this grade. They normally have the resources to do so unless
disaster or war strikes their lands. In rare instances, household knights whose lords are exceptionally wealthy may be
kept at this grade.

During Step 6, the knight receives a +1 modifier when rolling on the Child Survival table and a +3 modifier on the
Childbirth table.

#### Superlative
Only the richest knights and greatest lords can maintain themselves at this grade. During Step 5, the knight receives
a +2 modifier when rolling on the Horse Survival table and a +3 modifier on the Childbirth table. During Step 6, he
receives a +3 modifier when rolling on the Child Survival table and a +5 modifier on the Childbirth table.

### Clothing Value
For all grades of maintenance, reduce the character’s best suit of clothing to half its previous value. This reflects the
fact that even the most expensive formal clothes go quickly out of style, in addition to suffering normal wear and tear.
New clothes can be purchased if the knight has the means (again, see [Standards of Living](#standards-of-living).

## Step 5: Stable Rolls
Every horse owned by the knight must be checked to see if it survived the winter. Horses may die, given bad luck or poor
conditions of care.

Roll d20 for each horse owned, applying appropriate modifiers.

d20 Result | Horse's Fate
---------- | ------------
1 - 2 | Horse dies or is ruined
3 or more | Horse remains healthy

> _Note:  All horses suffer a –1 modifier for each year of the horse’s age beyond 7 years._

Vassal knights may get new animals from their lord at some point during the following year’s scenario, as needed, to
maintain the minimum stable of one charger, two rouncys, and one sumpter. Any additional or unusual horses (superior
chargers, destriers, unique horses) that perish need not be replaced.

## Step 6: Family Rolls
Your character’s family already exists, but children are desirable, especially for a vassal knight. The ideal way to
gain children is through marriage. Once a marriage is achieved, legitimate children are possible. The wife’s Glory and
dowry are also desirable — see below.

If your character is unmarried and wishes to remain so this winter, you may skip the marriage and childbirth portions
of this step. (If you wish to roll on the childbirth table but not the marriage table, you may do that as well.)

### Marriage
When a player wishes his character to marry, the Gamemaster rules whether this honor is possible for the character at
this point in the campaign. A marriage may require some roleplaying to find the wife; alternately, the Random Marriage
table can be used. No characters start the game already married.

Most knights’ marriages are one of two types — marriage below one’s class or marriage within one’s class. To marry above 
your class, such as into a count’s or a duke’s holding, requires game play, not random die rolls.

Any knight may choose to have "kept women" (i.e., those which are not wives), but they each require a fee of $10 per year. 
If payment can’t be made, then the knight was unable to maintain the woman’s interest or health and she has departed. 
Wives do not require extra payment of this kind; their costs are figured into the knight’s stipend or holding 
(see [Standards of Living](#standards-of-living)).

#### Below Your Class
Use this course of action whenever your character wants to have a wife, no matter what or who. She is probably a handmaid 
to your lord’s wife, a serving woman, an assistant seamstress to some rich merchant woman, or the younger sister of 
another knight. Household knights usually marry this way.

The Gamemaster should almost always permit this form of marriage, unless the character has been absent from home for 
years or is impoverished and shamed, or unless the marriage would not fit in well with the scenarios he intends to run.

The procedure is simple. Get permission from the character’s lord by making a Loyalty (lord) roll. If this roll is 
successful, the lord grants you the boon to wed. If your knight has not already chosen an available woman, the lord 
selects an appropriate match. Your are thus married to an ordinary woman who has a dowry of 1d6 and 10 Glory.

If the Loyalty roll fails, your lord refuses you permission to wed, although you may ask again next winter. A fumble 
might indicate that the lord was offended somehow, or that something humorous happened, but a fumble should never 
indicate marriage to an unsuitable woman unless the Gamemaster and the player agree to it.

#### Within Your Class
For a vassal knight or higher noble, it may take time to find a likely candidate for marriage. The Gamemaster should 
personalize potential wives who hold great dowries and have great Glory.

To find an ordinary wife within your character’s class, make a Courtesy roll. If successful, you may either roll on the 
Random Marriage table below, or wait a year. If you choose to wait until the next Winter Phase, write "met candidate 
for marriage, still waiting" (or something to that effect) in your character’s history. You can wait for as many years 
as you want, if there is no pressure from your lord.

For each year you make a successful Courtesy roll but choose to wait for marriage, add a +1 modifier to the d20 die roll 
on the Random Marriage table when you finally do roll. (If you fail your Courtesy roll during any year, you do not gain 
the +1 for that year.)

When you decide to roll for a marriage, you get only one chance. If you get what seems to be a poor match financially, 
assume that the marriage provides some significant political benefit for your lord instead (which may or may not impact 
your character directly).

### Random Marriage

d20 Result | Dowry | Glory
---------- | ----- | -----
1 - 4 | No holding, $1d3+6 | 10
5 - 7 | 1 manor, $1d6 | 25
8 - 17 | 1 manor, $1d6+3 | 50
18 - 19 | 2 manors, $1d6+6 | 100
20 or more | 2 manors, $2d6+6 | 250

> _Note: The number of libra (£) is likely to be composed at least half of valuable items like rugs, hangings, furs,
furniture, and the like._

### Children
Characters normally make a d20 roll on the Childbirth table once per year whether they are married or not, whether
rolling for a wife, concubine, lover, camp follower, or simply a some woman they have encountered during play within
the previous year.

If the Gamemaster permits it, up to one annual childbirth roll may be attempted per wife, lover, or concubine, if
sufficient opportunity was fulfilled during play to possibly allow conception.

#### Childbirth

d20 Result | Childbirth
---------- | ----------
1 - 10 | No children
11 | Mother and child die at childbirth
12 | Child born, but mother dies dies in childbirth
13 | Twins born
14 or more | Child born

> _Note: Roll 1d6 for each child born, where an odd number = female, and even = male._

After checking for new children, roll a d20 for each child the character has (if any) under 15 years of age — including
the newborn — and consult the Child Survival table. Children who survive to age 15 are assumed to live to adulthood.

#### Child Survival

d20 Result | Consequence
---------- | -----------
1 - 2 | Child dies
3 - 10 | Child is ill, but lives
11 or more | Child lives

### Family Events
This section determines whether any important or unusual events occur in your extended family. Note that the fathers and
grandfathers of player knights created in this book are already dead, and all inherited Glory and items already gained
thereby.

Each character rolls once per winter on the Family Events table.

#### Family Events Table

d20 Result | Consequence
---------- | -----------
1 - 2 | Death in family
3 - 7 | Marriage in family
8 - 12 | Birth in family
13 - 15 | Family member is missing or lost
16 - 18 | No event
19 - 20 | Rumor of scandal (roll on [Scandalous Rumors](#scandalous-rumors)

#### Scandalous Rumors
d20 Result | Consequence
---------- | -----------
1 | Insulted a lord
2 - 3 | Cheated at a tournament
4 | Impoverished, badly in debt
5 - 7 | Adulterer
8 | Kidnapper
9 - 10 | Horse-thief
11 - 16 | Illicit love affair
17 | Murderer
18 | Heretic
19 | Necromancer
20 | Roll again (Re-rolls 20s), but this time the rumor is proved true!

Next, roll on the table below to find the person most directly affected by the result of the event discovered. If the
result is ridiculous, like someone remarrying while their spouse is still alive or your grandmother being a horse-thief
(or anyone who is already dead taking any action!), then re-roll.

#### Impacted Family Member Table
d20 Result | Family Member
---------- | -------------
1 - 3 | Father
4 - 6 | Mother
7 - 10 | Brother
11 - 14 | Sister
15 | Uncle
16 | Aunt
17 | Grandfather
18 | Grandmother
19 - 20 | Cousin

## Step 7: Training and Practice
This step includes any weapon training or practice done over the winter, and allows deliberate changes to attributes,
traits, and passions.

If the Gamemaster permits it, your knight’s squire can also increase one or more of his three primary skills (listed on
the character sheet) at this time, using the same choices as your knight.

During this step, you may choose to do any one of the following three things:

### Choice 1: Gain 1d6 + 1 Points in Skills (To Max 15)
Roll 1d6+1 for the number of points available to you to improve your skills. Any combination of one or more skills or
combat skills may be improved, but you may not improve a NonKnightly skill in this way, and no skill may be raised to
 higher than 15.

### Choice 2: Gain 1 Point in a Skill (To Max 20)
You may increase any one skill by 1 point, to a maximum value of 20. Skills can go beyond 20 only by means of experience
or Glory. (See [Step 2](step-2-experience-rolls) and [Step 9](#LINK-ME).)

### Choice 3: Improve an Attribute, Trait, or Passion
You may raise or lower any one attribute, trait, or passion value by 1 point. (Keep in mind that altering a trait this
always also alters the value of the opposite trait as well.) Several restrictions apply: No trait can be increased to
over 19, and passions cannot be increased over 20. No attribute can be raised higher than its maximum cultural value
(see Character Generation). A character’s SIZ may not be increased after he reaches age 21; further, a character
cannot increase any other attribute (STR, DEX, CON, or APP) after he reaches age 35.

## Step 8: Compute Glory
During the winter, all Glory gained during the previous year’s play is computed. The total is then added to the current
number in the main [Glory](#glory) box on the character sheet. The sequence is one of the high points of the game for
many players, as they see their character’s fame and prestige increase through [Glory](#glory).

Check with the Gamemaster to be sure you record all the various Glory awards correctly. See [Glory](#glory).

### Glory from Play
This is the primary source of Glory. If you participated in a scenario last game year, the Glory gained by your character
should already be written in the "Glory this Game" box on the character sheet, and ideally recorded in detail on the
back of the sheet with a date attached. For example, if you killed a bear while hunting, you might have recorded an
award of 10 Glory.

Transfer the Glory from "Glory this Game" into the main "Glory" box, adding the two totals together for your current
total Glory.

### Glory from Solo Scenario
Your character may have gone through a solo scenario at the beginning of this Winter Phase. With Gamemaster approval,
Glory may have been gained thereby. For example, the solo scenario entitled "Your Own Land" (see Appendix 3) might have
gained you special Glory equal to your Just trait.

### Glory from Unique Honors
If any special honor or ambition was achieved last year, such as marriage to an heiress, this honor should have been
recorded on the back of the character sheet. Review your character’s achievements for the previous year.

### Annual Glory
Many sources of Glory accrue annually. For example, holding a motte-and-bailey castle gains you 8 Glory per year. Annual
Glory accrues now.

## Step 9: Glory Bonuses
The final step of the Winter Phase is to add any bonus points gained from high Glory to the character’s attributes. A
bonus point is gained whenever your total Glory exceeds 1,000 points, and for every additional 1,000 points thereafter.
(For example, a knight’s Glory might increase from 1,800 to 3,010 in an extraordinary year, yielding 2 bonus points for
that year.)

Bonus points must be spent now, as soon as they become available. Each point may be applied directly to an attribute,
trait, passion, skill, or combat skill, increasing that statistic by 1 point. Only two restrictions apply to this
increase: No character may increase his attributes beyond their racial maximums, and no character past age 21 can
increase his SIZ stat.

If you increase an attribute score, recalculate any derived statistics related to that attribute. 

If a trait or passion has just been increased to 16 or higher by means of a bonus point, you do not gain Glory from that 
trait or passion until next year’s Winter Phase. The same is true for Glory gained if a character now qualifies for a 
Religious bonus (see "Magical Virtues" in Chapter 4), but the bonus itself (the +3 armor reduction bonus from Armor of
Honor, for example) is gained immediately and may be used during the coming year’s scenarios.

The daily measure of wealth is that which can be seen and partaken of. Rich people eat better, wear fancier clothes,
and have more luxurious homes. Knights, as members of the noble class, wear very nice clothing and eat well, whether
at their lord’s board or in their own manor. A normal vassal knight — i.e., the typical player knight — has an ordinary
knightly standard of living (spending from $6 to $8 per year), as shown below in [Grades of Maintenance](#grades-of-maintenance).

It is interesting and useful to compare knights’ standards with those of a typical peasant family of two adults and 
three children: The common peasant exists in a self-sufficient world where money is unknown, and the family makes, grows,
or barters for everything it needs. However, in monetary value, annual expense and income for the whole peasant family 
equals about $1 per year.

## Grades of Maintenance
The economic situation (or "grade") of a knight is quantified by the annual income allotted to him during each
[Winter Phase](#winter-phase). Five grades of knight exist for this purpose: Impoverished, Poor, Ordinary, Rich, and
Superlative.

### Impoverished
A knight with an income of less than $3 per year is Impoverished. His is a miserable lot. He appears ragged, most likely 
lean and sickly, and his armor pitted and rusty. He has no squire and often lacks a horse of any kind. As a result, an 
Impoverished knight counts only as a sergeant in battle (see "Ransom and Blood Price"), even though he may be far more 
skilled or valorous. Legally, impoverishment means trouble.

An Impoverished household knight is not required to remain loyal to his lord since, under the feudal oath, his lord 
promised him sustenance. He may leave or may be sent away on a quest by the hapless lord.

On the other hand, if a vassal knight neglects his land to the point of impoverishment, the lord has the right to cancel 
their agreement and take the land back: The vassal has clearly failed to maintain the land and uphold his end of the 
feudal bargain.

> **Glory**: No Glory is gained during the Winter Phase for suffering the life of an Impoverished knight.

### Poor
Poor knights are, for whatever reason, unable to maintain themselves in the manner in which they ought. A knight who
receives between $3 and $5 per year is considered Poor. (A nearby sidebar expounds upon this state of relative poverty.)
In general, a Poor knight has no squire; rides a mangy, sway-backed horse; is hungry, lean, and ragged; and wears armor
in a sad state of disrepair.

> **Glory**: No effect. There is no shame, but no special fame, in being a poor knight.

### Ordinary
Ordinary knights are those most often discussed in Pendragon; generally, whenever the word "knight" is used, unmodified
by another adjective, it refers to a character of this economic standing. Ordinary knights comprise the majority of
chivalry. Player knights always begin the game as Ordinary knights in terms of economic quality.

An Ordinary knight receives $6 to $8 per year in money and food, which keeps himself, his family, a single squire, and
his horses in a healthy and robust manner of living, and his equipment in good repair. This may be provided by his lord,
or by a normal manor.

> **Glory**: No effect.

### Rich
Rich knights receive between $9 and $12 per year to spend on their maintenance, an amount significantly above normal
standards. Their families live well off the fat of the land.

Rich knights usually wear clothing of rich fabrics and furs in the latest style, have ornate silver-decorated tack for
their glossy-coated horses, and regularly enjoy rich feasts. They typically have two squires in attendance, both being
well-mounted and attentive to their knight’s needs.

> **Glory**: Knights who live above their expected means (i.e., more than $8 per year) gain Glory equal to the annual
number of maintenance libra spent; thus, a knight who has $11 per year also gains 11 Glory per year.

If a lord supplies this maintenance, rather than the knights’ getting the money themselves, the lord also gains a like
amount of Glory.

### Superlative
Superlative knights are the most extravagant and impressive of all, requiring $13 per year or more for upkeep. Their
armor shines brightly, and their clothing is sumptuous, with intricate stitching, extensive use of gold thread, jewels,
imported feathers, and furs from fantastic beasts. Three squires, each proud in matching livery, typically attend the
knight’s needs.

Superlative knights also benefit from superior health and the aid of well-equipped, loyal squires in battle.

> **Glory**: As noted under Rich knights, above, knights who live above their expected means gain additional annual
Glory based on their income.

# Combat Rules

## Injury and Health
The raison d’etre of the knight is to fight, and much of the action in the game revolves around personal or military
combat — which often results in injury, whether minor or mortal. Knights expect to take injury, and they wear their
many scars proudly.

In Arthurian literature, knights often suffer great wounds, and thereafter go through long periods of healing and rest
to recover. Such events are realistic as well as authentic to the stories. The following rules attempt to formalize this
process, while leaving the Gamemaster enough ﬂexibility to deal with all possible situations.

Keeping track of injuries and healing is a complicated process. Both the Gamemaster and players are responsible for
recording information accurately and honestly. You may wish to simplify portions of these rules while learning the game,
but they should be used in full once familiarity is gained. The reward will be a more authentic and dramatic experience.

Violence in Pendragon should be realistic and terrifying, never casual or routine, and the best way to achieve this is
to make injuries a serious matter.

### Hit Points
Health in Pendragon is measured primarily through the Total Hit Points statistic (calculated using SIZ + CON). This
number represents the character’s capacity to absorb injury. Death is imminent if a character has 0 or negative hit
points. In essence, though, a character with only half his hit points is half-dead.

#### Losing Hit Points
As damage is taken during the game, hit points are lost. The player records this loss, in pencil, using the workspace
on the character sheet labeled "Current Hit Points."

Characters may lose hit points from many different sources. Some forms of damage cause wounds, while some act directly
on hit points. Fatigue alone never causes hit point loss.

Once injured, characters may lose further hit points through illness, infection, excess activity, blood loss, or worse.
These factors are summarized under the "Deterioration and Aggravation" rules below. Deterioration may be prevented by
the unsophisticated medicine of the times, known as Chirurgery. Aggravation is caused by excessive activity while a
character is already injured or ill, and may be averted only by avoiding such activity.

#### Regaining Hit Points
A character’s recovery from injury is a natural bodily process, which is quantified as that character’s Healing Rate,
calculated as (STR + CON) ÷ 10. Characters normally recover a number of hit points equal to their Healing Rate every
week (on Sunday at noon, in fact), although the Gamemaster may adjust this schedule if necessary.

The First Aid skill lets the injured character regain hit points immediately, and ensures that bleeding is stopped,
infection prevented, and so forth. A critical success with the Chirurgery skill augments a patient’s Healing Rate.
(See [First Aid](#first-aid) and [Chirurgery"](#chirurgery))

Magical healing may cure hit points or otherwise magically improve a character’s health, at the Gamemaster’s option. As
always, the details of healing magic are secrets known only to the Gamemaster (and to a few unique Gamemaster characters).

In all cases, any hit points that would be regained over the value of the Total Hit Points statistic are lost.

#### Unconscious
As a character loses hit points, he reaches a point at which he becomes unconscious. This important threshold is
represented by the Unconscious statistic, equal to Total Hit Points ÷ 4.

Characters with current hit points below the Unconscious value are out of action. At the moment a character goes below
this threshold, he slumps slowly to the ground, possibly staggering a few yards first or sliding gently off his horse
before collapsing. (A DEX roll is allowed for a mounted character who becomes unconscious, with success indicating that
any falling damage is averted; otherwise, he takes another 1d6 points from the fall.)

The Gamemaster may wish to let unconscious characters have brief periods of lucidity. With Gamemaster approval, they may
be allowed to speak quietly. For example, they might be capable of slowly dictating a will, praying for divine guidance,
or describing an assailant in a weak whisper. (See the "A Fight to the Death" sidebar.)

Since they have been gravely injured, unconscious characters are considered unhealthy (see "States of Health") and must
check the "Chirurgery Needed" box on their character sheet immediately. They require chirurgery until the Gamemaster says
otherwise.

Example of Injury and Unconsciousness: In a tremendous fight, Sir Ambrut is victorious over two Saxon assailants. Ambrut
takes no Major Wound in the fight due to his heroic CON of 21. However, he takes many minor injuries, including a fall
from his horse, for a total of 26 points of damage, leaving him with 8 current hit points.

Since 8 is below Ambrut’s Unconscious value of 9, the sorely wounded knight staggers into a wood near the battlefield and
falls unconscious. His player checks Ambrut’s "Chirurgery Needed" box at once.

#### Zero or Negative Hit Points

# Adventuring
A primary activity of all the famous knights during Arthur’s time and after is to adventure. Adventuring, in fact, is the 
activity that sets famous knights apart from those lesser knights who stay at home and acquire Glory passively (i.e., 
while out of play).

Adventuring is recognized as a legitimate knightly duty by the Arthurian court, one every bit as important as one’s duty 
to stand garrison and serve an active 40 days in the field. Most knights do not take the job, though. For them, the 
everyday activities of guard duty, tournaments, and battles are enough to satisfy their sense of adventure.

Other knights (like the player knights, we hope), seek more and thus undertake dangerous and glorious quests. Most of 
the lords of Logres are in favor of this new "sport" of adventuring, and are happy to oblige those knights who wish to 
engage in it. The lull of peace following Arthur’s rise leaves castles full of boisterous fighters with nothing to fight. 
Adventuring sends the knights to work off their energy elsewhere, perhaps far away from Logres. Undoubtedly, the lord 
hopes that the questing knights’ vigor will arouse something from his other less enthusiastic knights, as well.

Adventures abound. Even stay-at-home knights have a few adventures as part of their routine, without having to go far to
seek them out. Such adventures include going to tournaments, participating in battles, engaging in romance, visiting
unusual sites, and encountering unusual beings.

## Questing
If knighthood is the heart of Pendragon, questing is its soul. A quests includes adventures, but not all adventures are
quests. A quest is a protracted series of adventures that must also include the following elements to qualify as such: 
going to an unknown place, encountering something mysterious or unusual, facing unusual dangers, and facing death. 
Quests must, by definition, occur in strange lands where High Adventure and opportunity wait to test the neat ideals of 
the heartland of civilization.

To go on a quest, a knight must request a leave from their normal duties to their lord. On a quest, as in any enterprise, 
a knight represents not only himself, but also his lord, so the lord will agree to send only individuals whom he will not 
have to bail out of trouble, or who will not bring shame or dishonor to him. A time limit is often imposed on absentee 
time for questing. The proverbial "year and a day" is a good starting time period. At the end of the leave period, the 
knight must return to court and report the results of his activities. In time, as a knight gains repute, the leave may 
be considerably longer, and sometimes even indefinite, particularly if it is assigned for a specific task. 

Of course, questing is also a "metagaming conceit," the best excuse for player knights to wander the roads and trails of 
Britain.
