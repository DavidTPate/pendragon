# Traits
Traits and passions allow us to quantify character behavior. Thus, they make the player’s roleplaying task easier by
providing guidelines for how the character has acted in the past, and thus how he is likely to continue to act.
Numerical values are assigned to each trait and each passion, and rolls are made using these values to determine
behavior. Of the two measures of character behavior, personality traits are more often used than passions.

Keeping track of character reputation is important. Characters with similar Glory totals may have very different
reputations, some good, some bad, some simply colorful.

Traits and passions are game mechanics for quantifying your character’s inner self, recording both repute and propensity.
They help you run your character in a consistent manner and according to his actual play activity.

## Ordinary Traits and Pasions
Traits and passions between 5 and 15 do not have to be rolled against if the player wishes to use his free will to
determine an action, although rolling is obviously the most impartial way to determine actions.

Characters who consistently act a certain way will eventually have the appropriate traits or passions valued at 16 or
higher, due to the rules below, at which time they will either have to make the required rolls or retire the character.

> **Modifiers**: Trait or passion values may be modified based on the situation, in order to keep the game realistic.
Players are responsible for reminding the Gamemaster when a situation might call for a trait or passion modifier. The
Gamemaster determines whether such modifiers are valid, and how much of a modifier should be applied.

## Famous Traits and Passions
A value of 16 or more in a particular trait or passion indicates tremendous interest and activity in that quality,
perhaps bordering on the fanatical. The behavior is very obvious to everyone, and is thus significant in roleplaying
terms as well as in game terms. New characters start play with only one value of 16, in one trait of your choice.

The threshold value for gaining Glory from a trait or passion is 16. If your knight has a Valorous trait of 15, he is
brave, but not particularly noteworthy for courage. Nor is a priest with a Piety of 6 particularly impious, nor is a
Love passion of 11 at all worthy of notice. But a knight whose Valorous statistic reaches 16 is considered heroic
beyond many other men and one with a Piety of 18 is nearly a saint, while a Love passion of 20 denotes one as being
famous throughout the realm for his passion.

This does not mean that trait rolls must be used whenever the character makes any decision in the game. And even
characters with famous characteristics are allowed free choice of behavior except when the plot demands otherwise. The
Gamemaster should request trait rolls only when a trait is tested in an important situation. In general, trait rolls
simulate situations in which a crisis forces the character to act unconsciously.

## Traits Over 19
Some extraordinary characters may have a trait valued of 20, 25, or perhaps even more! Scores above 19 are always the
result of increases made during the Winter Phase (or perhaps by Gamemaster ﬁat). Such characters always have a value of
0 for the opposite trait, and are known through all the land for their unrelenting, utterly fanatical behavior.

Unopposed rolls against these traits are handled as with any other unopposed roll having a value of 20 or higher — the
score is treated as 20, and any amount in excess of 20 is treated as a modifier to the roll itself.

As usual, trait values should be listed in pencil on the character sheet as whole numbers, each to one side of the
slash (/) mark.

## Penalizing and Reducing Traits and Passions
Values for traits and passions generally rise and fall repeatedly during the game. Experience checks for traits and
passions are assigned by the Gamemaster in a slightly different fashion from checks for skills
(see [Obtaining Experience](#obtaining-experience)). Players who are reluctant to roll should not be forced to;
however, if they consistently have their characters act against their established personalities, the Gamemaster must
have them check the trait or passion they actually exhibited, in order to simulate the possibility of a change in the
character’s psychology and reputation.

For example, the player of a knight with a Generous value of 13 wants to loot and pillage his foes at every turn and
constantly talks about the amount of money (or lack thereof) his character has. This attitude and behavior is not in
keeping with the Generous trait, so the Gamemaster is perfectly within his rights to tell the character to check his
Selfish trait the next time he expresses the desire to loot an enemy.

Passions are particularly vulnerable to reduction. When a character acts against a passion, no check is assigned -
instead, the Gamemaster simply instructs the player to reduce the value of the passion by 1 point immediately.

> **Note**: Any failed passion roll causes the character to lose 1 point.

Acting consistently according to character will prevent compulsory checks and reductions from being imposed.

The traits and passions system is not to be used to turn the player knights into puppets. Most of the time characters
just do whatever the player wishes them to do, collecting checks along the way. However, if your character has a
reputation, it’s only fair that he maintains it or loses it.

## Evil or Undesirable Behavior
It is not at all in the spirit of the game for player characters to become evil knights. However, players are
encouraged to take minor character flaws such as cruelty or laziness for their characters; such traits can be very
amusing in moderation, and also provide the Gamemaster with more opportunities to create interesting situations.

With one or two undesirable traits or inferior passion values, characters can have weaknesses other than those revealed
only in mortal combat, giving the Gamemaster the possibility of creating non-lethal challenges for characters. Given
the dangers involved in combat, this is a useful opportunity.

## Using Traits
When the opportunity arises to have your character behave one way or another, traits can be used as casual guidelines,
or rolls against the appropriate trait may be imposed by the Gamemaster.

Most of the time, you simply state what you want your character to do and he does it, possibly receiving an experience
check in the process (see [Obtaining Experience](#obtaining-experience)). Sometimes, though, behavior takes precedent
over conscious intent. Most of us have experienced doing something without thinking, and a trait roll duplicates that
kind of situation.

## Assigning Traits
The personality traits used in Pendragon consist of thirteen opposed pairs of virtues and vices. Note, though, that
what is a virtue in one culture is sometimes a vice in another. Thus, Christian and pagan cultures, for instance,
view the contrast between Modesty and Pride in a very different light.

All initial characters begin with a moral base derived from either British or Roman Christianity or from Paganism.

To determine your character’s starting traits, follow these three steps:

### Step 1: Religious Background
Initial traits are modified by the religious background. On your character sheet, underline those traits which your
character’s religion deems the most important, as follows:

#### Roman Christian Virtues
* Chaste
* Forgiving
* Merciful
* Modest
* Temperate

#### British Christian Values
* Chaste
* Energetic
* Generous
* Modest
* Temperate

#### Pagan Virtues
* Generous
* Energetic
* Honest
* Lustful
* Proud

### Step 2: Assign Values to the Traits
The Valorous trait always begins at a value of 15, reflecting your character’s martial training. The Religious traits
listed above begin at a value of 13. All of the remaining traits begin at 10.

Next, note that every "virtue" has its opposing "vice," located on the opposite side of the slash. For example,
Forgiving is balanced by Vengeful, and Prudent by Reckless. The total on the two sides of the slash must equal 20.
Complete your trait statistics by subtracting the values you have already assigned from 20, and filling in the resulting
number opposite the chosen trait. Thus, if your character has a score of 13 in Forgiving, he also has a 7 in Vengeful;
if he has a 10 in Prudent, he also has a 10 in Reckless.

As your character develops, these initial values will change, and various rewards may become available.

### Step 3: Assign Your "Famous Trait"
You may assign a value of 16 to any one trait, including those on the right side of each binary, such as Worldly or
Reckless, if you desire. Assigning this value of 16 is optional. If you do assign a 16, put it in a trait that denotes
the behavior for which you wish your character to be renowned. Be sure to adjust the corresponding trait
(the opposite side of the binary pair) to a value of 4.

> **Important**: For your first character, be sure to choose a "famous trait" you can live with. Since this value shows
how your character has acted in his youth, be sure the trait is in line with your intended actions and attitudes for the
character.

Further, note that having a trait over 15 decidedly affects the player’s actual control over a character! Your
character’s actions may be determined by the trait and contrary to your wishes as a player. For example, a character
with an Honest trait of 16 tells the truth in almost all situations, even those where deception might be advisable!
The game system assures this.

## Directed Traits
Leave these blank for now. They are discovered during game play.

## Rolling for Traits
During play, character behavior is often challenged by the Gamemaster. Temptations are paraded forth, moral crises
heaped up, and critical judgments and actions thrown forward.

Since traits and passions deﬁne character personality, they must be consulted whenever the Gamemaster feels them
necessary. In crises, it is assumed, individuals act according to their character, not spontaneous and ambiguous
choices. Custom and training triumph over instinct. Players may not want their characters to do something dictated by a
die roll, but free choice is not always possible.

# Passions
Passions are strong emotional and psychological propensities within any individual. These include Love, Hate, Loyalty,
Envy, and Honor, among others. Beginning characters all begin with ﬁve passions: Loyalty (to their lord), Love
(of family), Hospitality, Honor, and Hate (of Saxons).

## Famous Traits and Passions
See [Famous Traits and Passions](famous-traits-and-passions)

## Ordinary Traits and Passions
See [Ordinary Traits and Passions](ordinary-traits-and-passions)

## Starting Passions
Passion | Starting Value
------- | --------------
Loyalty (lord) | 15
Love (family) | 15
Hospitality | 15
Honor | 15
Hate (Saxons) | Roll 3d6

Once these values are assigned, a player may (but need not) raise one or more of her character’s passions by
distributing up to 3 points among them. See [Chapter 4 for more information on passions](#LINK-ME).

## Types of Passions
The Gamemaster might allow other passions for a character by at the start, and characters acquire passions as the result
of game play. The core passions are listed below:

### Loyalty
Loyalty is the prime virtue and passion of the medieval world — without it the feudal system could not exist. Most
knights believe in the axiom "King before God." Showing obedience to one’s immediate overlord is always correct
behavior, and disobedience to a lord is shocking to all true knights.

### Love (of family)
Love of family is a natural emotion common to humankind in any age or culture. To most people, family equates to society
in microcosm, which in turn represents their world. Further, the travel restrictions of the Arthurian era emphasize
family closeness.

### Hospitality
Everyone learns Hospitality at his or her mother’s knee, and it is so ingrained that it is almost subconscious.

### Honor
* Honor is the knight’s special passion. All knights must retain a value of 4 or higher in Honor, or they risk losing
their knighthood. (See [Honor in Chapter 4 for more information.](#LINK-ME))

### Hatred (of Saxons)
Hatred of the Saxons is an inherited passion of all Salisbury residents.

# Glory
Any dramatic pattern of behavior gains Glory. As a result, characters with interesting personalities gain more Glory
than those without. However, behavior in accordance with society’s ideals still gains more Glory than actions arising
from one’s idiosyncrasies or peculiarities. Thus, Gawaine gains much more Glory for his chivalrous nature than Agravaine
gains from his streak of cruelty.

# Obtaining Experience
Every skill, trait, or passion that can change as a result of learning is marked on the character sheet by having a box
(❏) near it. This box is checked (✓) when the character gains signiﬁcant experience during an adventure with a skill,
trait, or passion. Statistics do not change immediately as a result of this experience, though annual training may
increase them.

## Experience From Skills
There are times during play when the Gamemaster tells the player to check one of his character’s skills
(under ["Skills" or "Combat Skills" on the sheet](#LINK-ME)). This means that the character has successfully used
that skill in a time of crisis and may, at a future time, learn from the experience.

A box may be checked only when the Gamemaster says the player may do so. The mark reminds the player to check the
skill later, during the Winter Phase, to see if any learning occurred.

Experience checks for skills are intended to be very difficult to gain, and are not automatic whenever a success is
achieved. Gamemasters must explain this point to the players. The ability to award or deny an experience check is one
of the key powers of the Gamemaster.

Note that a squire’s skills may increase in the same manner as a player knight’s skills.  A check for a skill is
possible only if at least one of the following two statements pertains:

1. A critical success is achieved. If a character does his best possible, learning is likely.
1. A success in a significant situation is achieved. Even a dozen successful attacks on a gang of poorly armed peasant
levies would not be justification for a check to a weapon skill, since no real risk or challenge was incurred by the
attacker, and nothing important was achieved by their defeat.

## Experience From Traits and Passions
As with skills, there are times during play when the Gamemaster tells a player to check one of his character’s traits
or passions. This means that the character has displayed significant behavior in accordance with that trait. This
action or behavior does not necessarily have to be observed by other characters or players.

If the rules for traits or passions request a roll, this means that your character might learn something, if he acts or
feels the right way. But his actions are not yet clear, or significant enough. A successful roll means he might get the
check, too.

## Results of Experience Checks
When a character has a check next to a skill, trait, or passion, the player must make an experience roll during the
[Winter Phase](#LINK-ME). If the roll is successful, the checked value increases by 1 point. Experience rolls may bring
skills over 20, with luck.
