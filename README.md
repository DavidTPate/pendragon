# Traits
Traits and passions allow us to quantify character behavior. Thus, they make the player's roleplaying task easier by
providing guidelines for how the character has acted in the past, and thus how he is likely to continue to act.
Numerical values are assigned to each trait and each passion, and rolls are made using these values to determine
behavior. Of the two measures of character behavior, personality traits are more often used than passions.

Keeping track of character reputation is important. Characters with similar Glory totals may have very different
reputations, some good, some bad, some simply colorful.

Traits and passions are game mechanics for quantifying your character's inner self, recording both repute and propensity.
They help you run your character in a consistent manner and according to his actual play activity.

## Ordinary Traits and Pasions
Traits and passions between 5 and 15 do not have to be rolled against if the player wishes to use his free will to
determine an action, although rolling is obviously the most impartial way to determine actions.

Characters who consistently act a certain way will eventually have the appropriate traits or passions valued at 16 or
higher, due to the rules below, at which time they will either have to make the required rolls or retire the character.

> **Modifiers**: Trait or passion values may be modified based on the situation, in order to keep the game realistic.
Players are responsible for reminding the Gamemaster when a situation might call for a trait or passion modifier. The
Gamemaster determines whether such modifiers are valid, and how much of a modifier should be applied.

## Famous Traits and Passions
A value of 16 or more in a particular trait or passion indicates tremendous interest and activity in that quality,
perhaps bordering on the fanatical. The behavior is very obvious to everyone, and is thus significant in roleplaying
terms as well as in game terms. New characters start play with only one value of 16, in one trait of your choice.

The threshold value for gaining Glory from a trait or passion is 16. if your knight has a Valorous trait of 15, he is
brave, but not particularly noteworthy for courage. Nor is a priest with a Piety of 6 particularly impious, nor is a
Love passion of 11 at all worthy of notice. But a knight whose Valorous statistic reaches 16 is considered heroic
beyond many other men and one with a Piety of 18 is nearly a saint, while a Love passion of 20 denotes one as being
famous throughout the realm for his passion.

This does not mean that trait rolls must be used whenever the character makes any decision in the game. And even
characters with famous characteristics are allowed free choice of behavior except when the plot demands otherwise. The
Gamemaster should request trait rolls only when a trait is tested in an important situation. in general, trait rolls
simulate situations in which a crisis forces the character to act unconsciously.

## Traits Over 19
Some extraordinary characters may have a trait valued of 20, 25, or perhaps even more! Scores above 19 are always the
result of increases made during the Winter Phase (or perhaps by Gamemaster fiat). Such characters always have a value of
0 for the opposite trait, and are known through all the land for their unrelenting, utterly fanatical behavior.

Unopposed rolls against these traits are handled as with any other unopposed roll having a value of 20 or higher — the
score is treated as 20, and any amount in excess of 20 is treated as a modifier to the roll itself.

As usual, trait values should be listed in pencil on the character sheet as whole numbers, each to one side of the
slash (/) mark.

## Penalizing and Reducing Traits and Passions
Values for traits and passions generally rise and fall repeatedly during the game. Experience checks for traits and
passions are assigned by the Gamemaster in a slightly different fashion from checks for skills
(see [Obtaining Experience](#obtaining-experience)). Players who are reluctant to roll should not be forced to;
however, if they consistently have their characters act against their established personalities, the Gamemaster must
have them check the trait or passion they actually exhibited, in order to simulate the possibility of a change in the
character's psychology and reputation.

For example, the player of a knight with a Generous value of 13 wants to loot and pillage his foes at every turn and
constantly talks about the amount of money (or lack thereof) his character has. This attitude and behavior is not in
keeping with the Generous trait, so the Gamemaster is perfectly within his rights to tell the character to check his
Selfish trait the next time he expresses the desire to loot an enemy.

Passions are particularly vulnerable to reduction. When a character acts against a passion, no check is assigned -
instead, the Gamemaster simply instructs the player to reduce the value of the passion by 1 point immediately.

> **Note**: Any failed passion roll causes the character to lose 1 point.

Acting consistently according to character will prevent compulsory checks and reductions from being imposed.

The traits and passions system is not to be used to turn the player knights into puppets. Most of the time characters
just do whatever the player wishes them to do, collecting checks along the way. However, if your character has a
reputation, it's only fair that he maintains it or loses it.

## Evil or Undesirable Behavior
it is not at all in the spirit of the game for player characters to become evil knights. However, players are
encouraged to take minor character flaws such as cruelty or laziness for their characters; such traits can be very
amusing in moderation, and also provide the Gamemaster with more opportunities to create interesting situations.

With one or two undesirable traits or inferior passion values, characters can have weaknesses other than those revealed
only in mortal combat, giving the Gamemaster the possibility of creating non-lethal challenges for characters. Given
the dangers involved in combat, this is a useful opportunity.

## Using Traits
When the opportunity arises to have your character behave one way or another, traits can be used as casual guidelines,
or rolls against the appropriate trait may be imposed by the Gamemaster.

Since traits and passions define character personality, they must be consulted whenever the Gamemaster feels them
necessary. in crises, it is assumed, individuals act according to their character, not spontaneous and ambiguous
choices. Custom and training triumph over instinct. Players may not want their characters to do something dictated by a
die roll, but free choice is not always possible.

Most of the time, you simply state what you want your character to do and he does it, possibly receiving an experience
check in the process (see [Obtaining Experience](#obtaining-experience)). Sometimes, though, behavior takes precedent
over conscious intent. Most of us have experienced doing something without thinking, and a trait roll duplicates that
kind of situation.

Modifiers may be used to underscore the demands and pressures of a situation.

### Standard Trait Roll Results

Roll Result | Effect
----------- | ------
Critical Success | An experience check is normally gained, and the character acts strongly in accordance with the trait.
Success | The character acts in accordance with the trait. The player may decide precisely what action ensues within that limitation. An experience check should be gained only if the action is somehow significant to the story or the character
Failure | Roll again, this time against the opposed trait. Success on this second roll means the character acts in accordance with that second trait. Failure indicates the player may choose freely how the character will act. No checks are given.
Fumble | The opposite trait is checked, and the character immediately acts in accordance with the checked trait.

### interpreting Trait Rolls
Each result of a trait roll has special implications, and high or low trait values may influence interpretation. Use of
traits is not the same as striking with a weapon or using a skill. The traits quantify a character's likelihood to act
in one of two generally opposed ways. Therefore it is not enough to know merely that a character does not feel
particularly merciful — the player must know whether the character actually acts cruelly. The binary traits of
Pendragon define the chances of either.

#### Critical Success
A critical success in a trait roll indicates that the character must act in the manner described by the trait. The
action need not be outrageous or extreme, but ought to be apparent enough to be noticed enough by others, and to make
the character feel that he has revealed strong emotions or perhaps even compromised his beliefs or his integrity in
some way.

At the Gamemaster's option, minor inspiration may be gained from a critical success with a trait, gaining the character
a +5 modifier to one skill selected by the player, lasting for the duration of the situation that provoked the roll.
Such inspiration should be gained only in rare instances, for it is usually the domain of passions, not traits. Still,
when a truly dramatic trait roll occurs, inspiration can make the process far more exciting. The possibility of
inspiration also makes trait rolls more entertaining in general.

#### Success
Success in a trait roll indicates that the knight felt, and was moved by, the feelings expressed by that trait. Thus,
if he made a Merciful roll, he feels that he should grant mercy in this instance. However, the player may choose to
have the character act in the opposite manner: The penalty for disobeying the roll result is a check in the opposite
trait.

#### Failure
Failure at a single die roll is not enough to force a character to act entirely opposite to his usual patterns of
behavior; the player must also roll against the opposite trait to see if chance and statistics force his character to
break pattern. Thus, only a successful roll within the range of a trait forces the player's hand.

### Conflicting Traits
in some cases, a character may be torn between two warring traits (that is, not an opposed trait pair like
Pious/Worldly, but entirely different virtues, such as Pious and Trusting).

By making an opposed roll between two unrelated traits, you may play your character's emotions off against each other,
emulating the deep introspection of someone tortured by internal doubts. You or your Gamemaster may also set opposed
tests of conflicting emotions, requiring you to make several separate unopposed trait rolls, with varying results
depending on which of them was successful and which failed.

Whichever traits are successful (if unopposed) or win (if opposed) receive experience checks if approved by the Gamemaster.

### Trait Disputes
Personality disputes between individuals, particularly between player knights and non-player characters, may be
determined by opposed resolution rolls of traits. The challenger matches his personality against his rival's.

Because personality traits have opposites, results are more complex when someone fails during opposed trait resolution
than is the case with other opposed skill rolls. Whenever a character receives a failed trait roll during a personality
dispute, his player must then attempt to roll the opposite trait. if that roll succeeds, then the character acts
accordingly, even though this means that behavior is not as intended.

The challenged party in a trait dispute has free reign to do as he pleases when he fails both trait rolls, having
managed to control their inclinations.

## Assigning Traits
The personality traits used in Pendragon consist of thirteen opposed pairs of virtues and vices. Note, though, that
what is a virtue in one culture is sometimes a vice in another. Thus, Christian and pagan cultures, for instance,
view the contrast between Modesty and Pride in a very different light.

All initial characters begin with a moral base derived from either British or Roman Christianity or from Paganism.

To determine your character's starting traits, follow these three steps:

### Step 1: Religious Background
initial traits are modified by the religious background. On your character sheet, mark those traits which your
character's religion deems the most important, as follows:

Religion          | Chaste | Energetic | Forgiving | Generous | Honest | Lustful | Merciful | Modest | Proud | Temperate
----------------- | ------ | --------- | --------- | -------- | ------ | ------- | -------- | ------ | ----- | ---------
Roman Christian   | :x:    |           | :x:       |          |        |         | :x:      | :x:    |       | :x:
British Christian | :x:    | :x:       |           | :x:      |        |         |          | :x:    |       | :x:
Pagan             |        | :x:       |           | :x:      | :x:    | :x:     |          |        | :x:   |

### Step 2: Assign Values to the Traits
The Valorous trait always begins at a value of 15, reflecting your character's martial training. The Religious traits
listed above begin at a value of 13. All of the remaining traits begin at 10.

Next, note that every "virtue" has its opposing "vice," located on the opposite side of the slash. For example,
Forgiving is balanced by Vengeful, and Prudent by Reckless. The total on the two sides of the slash must equal 20.
Complete your trait statistics by subtracting the values you have already assigned from 20, and filling in the resulting
number opposite the chosen trait. Thus, if your character has a score of 13 in Forgiving, he also has a 7 in Vengeful;
if he has a 10 in Prudent, he also has a 10 in Reckless.

As your character develops, these initial values will change, and various rewards may become available.

### Step 3: Assign Your "Famous Trait"
You may assign a value of 16 to any one trait, including those on the right side of each binary, such as Worldly or
Reckless, if you desire. Assigning this value of 16 is optional. if you do assign a 16, put it in a trait that denotes
the behavior for which you wish your character to be renowned. Be sure to adjust the corresponding trait
(the opposite side of the binary pair) to a value of 4.

> **important**: For your first character, be sure to choose a "famous trait" you can live with. Since this value shows
how your character has acted in his youth, be sure the trait is in line with your intended actions and attitudes for the
character.

Further, note that having a trait over 15 decidedly affects the player's actual control over a character! Your
character's actions may be determined by the trait and contrary to your wishes as a player. For example, a character
with an Honest trait of 16 tells the truth in almost all situations, even those where deception might be advisable!
The game system assures this.

## Directed Traits
Leave these blank for now. They are discovered during game play.A character may have strong feelings about someone or
something in particular that modify one or more of their traits. in game, these tendencies are referred to as directed
traits. Directed traits thus represent strong feelings or beliefs, but not strong enough to drive your character mad,
as a passion might (see [Passions])#passions)).

in situations where the directed trait might reasonably alter your character's actions or perceptions, he applies
its numeric value as a modifier on appropriate trait rolls. Some directed traits that might come up in play are as follows:

* Weakness for blondes (adds to Lustful rolls where blondes are involved)
* Mistrust Sir So-and-so (adds to Suspicious rolls where Sir So-and-so is involved)
* Mistrust London residents (adds to Suspicious rolls where London residents are involved)
* Forgiving of crying women (adds to Forgiving rolls where crying women are involved)
* Unjust towards Malahauts (adds to Arbitrary rolls where Malahauts are involved)
* Loves mead (adds to indulgent rolls where mead is involved)
* Fears boars (adds to Cowardly rolls where boars are involved)

## Trait Descriptions

### Chaste/Lustful
To be chaste is to be monogamous, or otherwise faithful to one's sexual mores. it does not always require virginity,
so a man being faithful to his wife is exhibiting the Chaste trait. A chaste person is modest and decorous in terms of
sexual or flirtatious behavior. (Note that a relatively chaste character can still make Flirting checks, but probably
does so in a rather demure or "innocent" manner.) A fanatically or famously chaste person is celibate and most likely
virginal.

Lustful describes sexual desire, and also implies sexual activity, often without personal commitment between the
persons involved. The pagan virtue of Lustful recognizes the value of this sensual art to appreciate the immanence of
the Goddess. Excessive promiscuity may be called lechery, wantonness, or bawdiness.

> **Famous Characters**: Sir Bors de Ganis is respected for his chastity.

### Energetic/Lazy
A vigorous person is Energetic. This trait includes the natural inclination to get up early, work hard, and apply
oneself fully to the tasks at hand. Energetic persons might be called vigorous, robust, or industrious.

Laziness includes all slothful activity, such as loafing and general sedentary behavior. At the furthest end of the
spectrum lies complete indolence.

> **Famous Characters**: Sir Lamorak de Gales is often admired for his energetic nature.

### Forgiving/Vengeful
To be forgiving means is to be willing to take insult without injury. A forgiving character is unlikely to seek revenge
for injuries intended or done to him. Extremely forgiving people are called "meek" (in the Biblical sense).

Vengeful indicates a character's propensity to seek revenge — perhaps only in petty ways, but possibly sweeping and
grandiose — for wrongs done or imagined. This trait also includes spitefulness.

> **Famous Characters**: Sir Gawaine is often noted for his vengeful streak.

### Generous/Selfish
Generous determines the impulse, learning, or desire to share with others. it includes the largesse of the Saxon and 
Cymric chieftains, and also the famed Christian virtue of Charity. Extremely generous persons are called unselfish, 
magnanimous, and big-hearted.

Selfish is the desire to possess, keep, and further accumulate things for oneself. Greed is usually a component of 
selfishness. This possessiveness usually regards material property and wealth, with the character being known as a 
miser or hoarder, but it might apply to Glory, so that the character always wishes to keep the most glorious tasks and 
duties for himself. Very selfish persons are labeled both stingy and self-serving.

> _Note: in some cases, jealousy is included under the Selfish trait. Thus when someone acts jealous, he may get a check for Selfish._

> **Famous Characters**: King Arthur and Queen Guenever are revered for their generosity. 
 
### Honest/Deceitful
To be honest is to deal truthfully with others, both in matters of import or triviality, no matter what the
consequences. Persons of extreme honesty are said to have integrity and to be trustworthy, scrupulous, and reliable.

A deceitful person is generally likely to distort truths, or to fabricate untruths, for his own ends (or perhaps on
behalf of others) — or in some cases, simply for the sake of doing so. Chronically deceitful people are called liars,
frauds, and false-hearted.

### Modest/Proud
To be modest is to be quiet and reserved about one's gifts and accomplishments, not seeking excessive attention in the
recitation of one's own deeds. A modest character is glad simply to perform deeds, rather than bask in the repeated
glory of hearing about them. Very modest people are called humble and reserved, or perhaps even shy.

The Proud trait indicates the degree to which one gets pleasure from hearing and/or boasting of his deeds. Both
Germanic and Pagan ways value Pride in a character. Excessive pride implies arrogance, and likely a boastful nature.

> **Famous Characters**: Sir Turquine, the feared Saxon knight, is notorious for his great pride.

### Just/Arbitrary
A just character is capable of telling what is right and wrong (within the mores of his upbringing and his personal
beliefs), and is desirous of passing due judgment based on that information. A very just person is called fair and
impartial.

Arbitrary means that the character has no concern for what is right or wrong, and uses other information and bases
for his decision making. Very arbitrary people are labeled unjust, unfair, wrongful, and probably biased and partial.

> **Famous Characters((: King Arthur is perhaps most famous for his extraordinary sense of justice.

### Merciful/Cruel
Mercy indicates a tendency to extend sympathy, pity, and aid to others. This includes sparing an enemy, giving money to
the poor, helping the weak, and any other act that is not expected of one's rank and station. A very merciful person is
called compassionate.

Cruel indicates a disregard for the feelings and needs of others, or lack of sympathy. High values in Cruel indicate
that the character actually enjoys the discomforts and troubles of others.

### Pious/Worldly
A pious character often dwells on spiritual matters, and is aware of them and their implications in the material world.
(This is not the same as worship, which is an action rather than a belief.) A pious person is a spiritual person.
An extremely pious person is devout or zealous, perhaps even saintly.

Worldly indicates a disregard or disbelief in the spiritual side of life. Extreme values might indicate blasphemy and
sacrilege. Alternatively, it might just indicate profligacy, taking great pleasure in temporal things such as fine
clothes, comfortable furnishings, good music and poetry, and the best company.

Do not confuse Worldly with Indulgent; the two often go hand-in-hand, but they are not the same.

> **Famous Characters**: Sir Galahad is the most pious knight in King Arthur's realm.

### Prudent/Reckless
The prudent character gives thought to what he does before he acts. Such a character is called cautious, and excessively
prudent people are called shrewd, circumspect, or discerning — or "slow to act."

The reckless character acts before he thinks things through, without concern for anything but the immediate consequences.
Almost any time someone gets a check for acting according to a passion, they will have acted rashly. An extremely
reckless character is called careless, or a hothead.

> **Famous Characters**: Sagramore le Desirious is decidedly rash, while Sir Dinadan is noted for being prudent.

### Temperate/Indulgent
Temperance means that a character takes only what he needs of food, drink, and other temporal needs. He is frugal and
abstains from excess. Extreme temperance indicates asceticism, perhaps even self-mortification.

An indulgent character is a gourmand: He takes pleasure in food and drink, both in quality and quantity. Extremes of
this indicate gluttony and drunkenness.

### Trusting/Suspicious
One who is trusting tends to believe information without any inclination to suspect its falsity. An excessively trusting
person is gullible and credulous, perhaps even a dupe.

Suspicious indicates that a person is unlikely to believe what he hears unless proof is offered. An extremely suspicious
person is called a skeptic or a doubter. A naturally suspicious person might still be extremely pious, however.

> _Note: In some cases, jealousy is included under the Suspicious trait. Thus when someone acts jealous, he may get a
check for Suspicious._

> **Famous Characters**: Sir Mordred is noted for his suspicious and skeptical behavior.

### Valorous/Cowardly
To be valorous means to be brave and courageous, willing to place oneself in danger for the sake of victory, friends, 
or the simple love of battle. Normal knights are valorous, and thus might be referred to as doughty, stalwart, or valiant. 
Extremely heroic individuals are often called fearless or intrepid. Valor may be exhibited not only in combat, but 
whenever risks to one's health or wellbeing are involved.

Cowardly means to be fearful of pain and of harm to one's self. Someone who is extremely faint-hearted is labeled as a 
poltroon, dastard, craven, caitiff, or recreant.

> **Famous Characters**: Sir Lancelot and Sir Lamorak are well known as the most valorous knights in Britain. 

# Passions
Passions are strong emotional and psychological propensities within any individual. These include Love, Hate, Loyalty,
Envy, and Honor, among others. Beginning characters all begin with five passions: Loyalty (to their lord), Love
(of family), Hospitality, Honor, and Hate (of Saxons).

Passions are strong personal emotions, including religion, love, hate, amor, loyalty, envy, and anything else that
the Gamemaster admits into the game. These passions provide a method of measuring a character's inner self. They help
the character follow the morals of his age, and let him benefit from being a notable example of proper (or improper)
behavior.

Passionate characters may perform with superhuman effort and a greater likelihood of success. However, passionate
characters are volatile and moody — their feelings may change instantly due to success or failure on a passion roll. 
Based on the success or failure of a passion roll, they are likely to be found in any one of several states of mind 
which are not found among dispassionate folk: inspiration, introspection, melancholy, shock, and even madness (all 
have effects in game terms, as described below).

## Using Passions
Invoking a passion is a good way for the Gamemaster to add excitement to a scenario. However, passion rolls are a
risky business for players. The results vary, but are likely to be dramatic.

The Gamemaster may call for a passion roll, possibly with a modifier for the particular situation. This roll is handled
as any other unopposed resolution (see Chapter 5), but uses the results found on Table 4–2: Standard Passion Results.

At other times the player may request a roll, with the Gamemaster's approval. Remember that the Gamemaster has final 
word on the appropriateness of attempting to use a passion for inspiration. Players are warned that passion rolls can
be extremely risky as well as rewarding, for they may subject a knight to several unusual states of mind, including
introspection, melancholy, and madness.

### Standard Passion Roll Results

Roll Result | Effect
----------- | ------
Critical Success | Character is inspired (see below) and acts strongly in accordance with the passion. Gain 1 point in the passion, plus an experience check (see [Obtaining Experience](#obtaining-experience)).
Success | Character is [Inspired](#inspired) and acts in accordance with the passion. Gain an experience check in the passion.
Failure | Character is [Disheartened](#disheartened) and immediately loses 1 point in the relevant passion unless the Gamemaster rules otherwise.
Fumble | Character is [Maddened](#maddened) and immediately loses 1 point in the passion.

#### Inspired
To be inspired is to have achieved the highest state of passion. Inspiration can turn an ordinary character into an
extraordinary one; it is the source for the greatness that many Round Table knights often exhibit.

An inspired character gains tremendous ability for a time. The player may choose any one skill or combat skill: His
character's value in that skill is modified as shown on the chart below, based upon whether he was inspired by a success
or a critical success in his passion roll.

Inspired By... | Benefit
-------------- | -------
Critical Success | Doubled or gains +20 modifier (whichever is higher)
Success | Gain +10 modifier

This inspiration lasts for the length of the task at hand, but never for more than one full day.

##### Shock
If a knight should somehow fail to perform a deed for which he was inspired, he suffers shock. In game terms, the
character must immediately make an [aging roll](#aging).

> _Note: The Gamemaster may impose shock on characters (with or without their first being inspired) in other appropriate 
situations as well. Likely circumstances for imposing such a state might be after the knight has just abandoned a 
lord or a lover to grave danger or a dire fate._

#### Disheartened
A disheartened knight suffers a –5 modifier on all further rolls made during the situation that brought on his state.
Once the situation passes, he then becomes [Melancholic](#melancholic).

##### Melancholic
Melancholy is a mental disorder that, when it manifests, causes the victim to be overwhelmed by grief. He or she may
fall to the ground weeping aloud, lamenting losses and ill luck, and crying out from deep emotional pain. Alternately,
a melancholic character might fall into a deep and morose depression.

If a melancholic knight is disturbed by another man, he falls into an maniacal rage, hoping to overcome his misery
through violence; he always attacks the disturbing individual unless it is a woman. The only way a man can hope to
calm a melancholic knight is by using "reverse psychology": The would-be healer must first succeed at an unopposed roll
using a trait of his choice. If he fails the roll, he fails to penetrate the victim's melancholy using that trait. He
may try again using a different trait.

Once the healer succeeds at a trait roll, he provokes an opposed roll from the victim on the opposite trait. (He is
assumed to have addressed the melancholic victim in such a way that he provokes a response.) If the melancholic
character's roll wins the resolution, he attacks, but if he loses he calms down and, a short time later, goes to
sleep. On a tie, the characters do what their players wish them to do.

In game terms, a bout of melancholia usually lasts for one full day.

#### Maddened
A character may be driven mad by his passions. This madness may occur at once, or once the relevant action is over 
(at the Gamemaster's discretion). Once madness sets in, the player must immediately give his character sheet to the 
Gamemaster, who describes what ensues based only on what the other player characters know and can perceive.

Normally, mad characters run away immediately. For the duration of their madness, they attempt to avoid the scene of 
their disastrous experience at all cost. A madman is out of play until the Gamemaster wishes to reintroduce him into 
the campaign — which may be years later, or perhaps never. Storytelling considerations should be dominant in 
determining how long a maddened character is gone.

If recovered, the madman will have undergone unusual, unknown circumstances that can result in changes to some 
attributes and/or skills, at the Gamemaster's option. Players should simply accept these changes, which may not always 
be negative.

The character's player remains unaware of precisely what has transpired while the character was in the Gamemaster's 
hands. However, once returned, a character may seek out knowledge of his actions while maddened, and by that means 
eventually determine where he went and what happened to him during his period of madness.

## Starting Passions
Passion | Starting Value
------- | --------------
Loyalty (lord) | 15
Love (family) | 15
Hospitality | 15
Honor | 15
Hate (Saxons) | Roll 3d6

Once these values are assigned, a player may (but need not) raise one or more of her character's passions by
distributing up to 3 points among them. See [Chapter 4 for more information on passions](#LiNK-ME).

## Types of Passions
The Gamemaster might allow other passions for a character by at the start, and characters acquire passions as the result
of game play. The core passions are listed below:

### Loyalty (lord)
Loyalty is the prime virtue of the medieval world — without it, the feudal system could not exist. Most knights believe
in "King before God," no matter what the priests tell them. Showing obedience is correct behavior, and disobedience to a
lord is shocking to all true knights

All knights must be knighted by someone, and the "Loyalty (Lord)" space on your character sheet is used for his loyalty
to that initial lord. The starting Loyalty (lord) value is 15 for vassal knights (and thus the default for player characters).

If the Gamemaster permits the play of a household knight with an assured household but no land, like Sir Ambrut, then
roll 2d6+6 for his Loyalty (lord) passion. If a player runs a homeless knight, his Loyalty to whoever knighted him is
only 2d6.

### Love (of family)
Love of family is a natural emotion common to humankind in any age. The travel restrictions of the medieval era were
severe, which reinforced family closeness. Serfs almost never traveled more than a day's walk from their birthplace.
Noblewomen were fortunate to travel across the country once a year. Thus, turning to one's kin for help was the
universal answer to any problem.

In character generation, new characters, who are by default eldest sons and thus destined to be the heads of their
immediate families, start with a powerful love for their family: A character's starting Love (family) value is equal to
15 for eldest sons. This default value is similar for all daughters of a household. 

However, less fortunate younger sons, often sent from the hearth, were more likely to find fault with their kin, and so 
expressed less loyalty to them. The second son gets a Love (family) value equal to 2d6+5; the third son, 2d6+4; the 
4th, 2d6+3; 5th, 2d6+2; 6th, 2d6+1; and 7th and any others 2d6. Other modifiers to the starting value may apply. 

### Hospitality
This passion measures how much your character respects the time-honored institution of hospitality. In cases of great 
passion (16 or higher), a proponent of this practice might feel bound to correct others' inhospitable behavior, and 
perhaps even to seek out and destroy those who break the rules of hospitality. On the other hand, anyone with a 
disregard for hospitality (less than 5) is likely to steal without compunction.

Whenever a character's behavior warrants it, the Hospitality statistic should be altered. If a character goes lurking 
and spying around in someone's castle, especially if he actually robs it of goods, he should lose at least 1 
Hospitality point immediately for breaking the rules of hospitality.

Similarly, if a character rises to defend the hospitality of someone else, he should get a check 
(see [Obtaining Experience](#obtaining-experience)) — especially if he defends the hospitality of someone for whom he 
really doesn't much care, or if he holds his own anger or hatred in check for the sake of another's hospitality.
(No check is given to someone defending his own home.)

All characters from the Cymric culture start with a Hospitality value of 15. 

### Honor
Honor is the passion that sets knights apart from ordinary people. It is a combination of personal dignity, integrity, and pride. Personal honor is not always a slippery issue. The Dishonorable Acts table, below, lists a number of things upon which everyone can agree as being dishonorable actions for a knight. Performing these deeds clearly and invariably diminishes honor — this is the code of knighthood to which knights have agreed.

#### Dishonorable Acts
Act | Honor Lost
--- | ----------
Attacking an unarmed knight | -1
Cowardice | -1
Desertion from battle or military service | -1
Plundering a holy place of your religion | -1
Killing an unarmed holy person of your religion | -2
Killing, kidnapping, or raping a noblewoman | -2
Lending money at a profit | -2
Performing physical labor | -2
Breaking an oath | -3
Flagrant cowardice | -3
Treachery against a member of your family | -5
Treason (against your lord) | -5
Killing a kinsman | -6
Learning to cast magical spells | -8

However, beyond the acts listed on Table 4–3, disagreement may arise as to what is or is not honorable, often because 
the honor of an action is personal rather than social.

The term "personal honor" is used carefully to separate such honor from other sworn or understood social obligations, 
including issues or behaviors covered by other passions. Thus, it is not possible for a knight to have his personal 
honor abused if someone insults his family — one's Love (family) passion covers that. Likewise, someone insulting 
one's lover should involve the Amor passion, not Honor.

But Honor can still cover many other things. In fact, it can include almost anything that a character chooses to 
include. Someone with an extremely high honor may be offended by anything that anyone says that he does not like. 
Rationality may have little if any bearing.

Honor is tied to traits more deeply than other passions usually are. The "integrity" component of Honor, for instance, 
is closely linked to the trait of Honest, while "pride" is obviously linked with the Proud trait. Thus, a knight might
be required to make a Proud trait roll by the Gamemaster and, upon losing, the player might then invoke the Honor 
passion (rather than the Modest trait) to help him through the event.

A dishonorable character suffers considerably in Arthurian society. He loses the trust of those about him, and in 
committing dishonorable acts probably incurs various punishments — monetary ﬁnes, banishment, forfeiture, blood feud,
etc. These social troubles are further reflected by rules concerning this passion.

Whenever a character's Honor is reduced to 4 or lower, he has proved himself unﬁt to bear the title of knight and 
serve a lord. His lord must either outlaw him or degrade him (i.e., strip him of knighthood). To fail to do so places
the lord's own status in jeopardy because he would be failing to uphold his own governance. Honor may eventually be 
regained at this grim point in a character's career.

If a character's Honor ever reaches 0, the player must remove that character from active play. Recovery from such a 
low state is simply not possible. If the player wishes to see him in the campaign, he must turn the character sheet 
over to the Gamemaster, who can play him as a Gamemaster character if he wishes.

A character's starting Honor value is 15.

### Hatred (of Saxons)
By default, hatred of the Saxons is an inherited passion of all starting characters. The depredations of these
foreigners have reached everyone in Britain. Characters begin with a Hate (Saxons) value of 3d6.

#### Other Common Passions
The most common passions of player characters are described in this section. Expect to encounter these in your game. Other passions are certainly possible.

##### Fear (

# Glory
Any dramatic pattern of behavior gains Glory. As a result, characters with interesting personalities gain more Glory
than those without. However, behavior in accordance with society's ideals still gains more Glory than actions arising
from one's idiosyncrasies or peculiarities. Thus, Gawaine gains much more Glory for his chivalrous nature than Agravaine
gains from his streak of cruelty.

# Obtaining Experience
Every skill, trait, or passion that can change as a result of learning is marked on the character sheet by having a box
(❏) near it. This box is checked (✓) when the character gains significant experience during an adventure with a skill,
trait, or passion. Statistics do not change immediately as a result of this experience, though annual training may
increase them.

## Experience From Skills
There are times during play when the Gamemaster tells the player to check one of his character's skills
(under ["Skills" or "Combat Skills" on the sheet](#LiNK-ME)). This means that the character has successfully used
that skill in a time of crisis and may, at a future time, learn from the experience.

A box may be checked only when the Gamemaster says the player may do so. The mark reminds the player to check the
skill later, during the Winter Phase, to see if any learning occurred.

Experience checks for skills are intended to be very difficult to gain, and are not automatic whenever a success is
achieved. Gamemasters must explain this point to the players. The ability to award or deny an experience check is one
of the key powers of the Gamemaster.

Note that a squire's skills may increase in the same manner as a player knight's skills.  A check for a skill is
possible only if at least one of the following two statements pertains:

1. A critical success is achieved. if a character does his best possible, learning is likely.
1. A success in a significant situation is achieved. Even a dozen successful attacks on a gang of poorly armed peasant
levies would not be justification for a check to a weapon skill, since no real risk or challenge was incurred by the
attacker, and nothing important was achieved by their defeat.

## Experience From Traits and Passions
As with skills, there are times during play when the Gamemaster tells a player to check one of his character's traits
or passions. This means that the character has displayed significant behavior in accordance with that trait. This
action or behavior does not necessarily have to be observed by other characters or players.

if the rules for traits or passions request a roll, this means that your character might learn something, if he acts or
feels the right way. But his actions are not yet clear, or significant enough. A successful roll means he might get the
check, too.

## Results of Experience Checks
When a character has a check next to a skill, trait, or passion, the player must make an experience roll during the
[Winter Phase](#LiNK-ME). if the roll is successful, the checked value increases by 1 point. Experience rolls may bring
skills over 20, with luck.
